It reveals the characteristics of slums and how these have changed over time. Spatially disaggregated data show that slum areas are very dense with poor-quality buildings, lacking access to key services such as sewage disposal and electricity. However, improvements to building quality, public-service provision, and socio-economic characteristics are mostly outpacing those seen in the formal sector. Measures such as child health and school attendance have caught up or are on pace to catch up in the near future with the formal sector, while improvements in building quality and service provision are advancing more slowly. We find significant heterogeneity across the city, and in particular that central slums look to be 'stuck' with low-quality buildings and poor service provision, though not with low socio-economic indicators. We explore potential explanations for why slums located on highly prized land near the centre may be stuck with poor infrastructure.","disorderly, disorganised, filthy,dirty,impoverished,marginalised, congested settlements,infrastructural scarcity",Negative,No,-,No,Descriptive,Conceptualization of slums,planning,"Improvement of life,livelihood improvement",-,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/oxrep/grx036

Almost one in seven people on the planet are expected to reside in urban informal settlements, or slums, by 2030. Slum upgrading is the process of delivering place-based environmental and social improvements to the urban poor, including land tenure, housing, infrastructure, employment, health services and political and social inclusion. The processes and products of slum upgrading can address multiple environmental determinants of health. This paper reviewed urban slum upgrading evaluations from cities across Asian, Africa and Latin Americann and found that few captured the multiple health benefits of upgrading. With the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) focused on improving well-being for billions of city-dwellers, slum upgrading should be viewed as a key strategy to promote health, equitable development and reduce climate change vulnerabilities. We conclude with suggestions for how slum upgrading might more explicitly capture its health benefits, such as through the use of health impact assessment (HIA) and adopting an urban health in all policies (HiAP) framework. Urban slum upgrading must be more explicitly designed, implemented and evaluated to capture its multiple global environmental health benefits.","disorderly, disorganised, filthy,dirty,impoverished,marginalised, congested settlements,infrastructural scarcity",Negative,No,-,No,Descriptive,Conceptualization of slums,planning,"Improvement of life,livelihood improvement",-,,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ijerph14040342

However, existing urban metabolic analyses exclude a detailed understanding of how urban slums function and contribute to biophysical, including energy, flows. This paper aims at filling this gap by critically investigating the notion of the urban slum in general, the extent to which it differs in the African context, specifically in South Africa, and broadening the understanding of urban slum based on the concept of urban metabolism, using the multi-scale integrated analysis of societal and ecosystem metabolism (MuSIASEM) approach, which was applied to the Enkanini informal settlement in Stellenbosch, South Africa. The analysis shows that South Africa has a more nuanced typology of the notion of urban slums categorised as: (i) townships; (ii) housing-turned-slum; (iii) squatter camps; (iv) site and service settlements; (v) transit camps; and (vi) hybrid multi-structured settlements. Beyond these definitions, the case study illustrates that urban slums, however defined, are complex systems with their own internal flows and processes that are connected in a myriad of ways to the larger urban system. The investigation into the use of Time, Money and Energy in the Enkanini case further revealed the productive (hypercyclic) and consumptive (dissipative) nature of the components of the urban informal settlement. This type of analysis reveals new insights into the linkages between urban informal settlements and the city.","disorderly, disorganised, filthy,dirty,impoverished,marginalised, congested settlements,infrastructural scarcity",Negative,No,-,No,Descriptive,Conceptualization of slums,planning,-,-,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cities.2016.12.018

The study stems from the authorâ€™s several years of work as a community design architect on slum upgrading projects, many of which were of a participatory nature.

This review sought to understand the scope, extent, and nature of current research on the health and wellbeing of older slum dwellers in sub-Saharan Africa. We searched 8 bibliographic databases for studies examining the health and wellbeing of older slum dwellers in the region. We also completed a grey literature search. The literature search together yielded 3,388 records, of which we selected 25 for review following a rigorous screening process. The included studies covered a variety of health issues of concern to older slum dwellers: (1) disease and injury prevalence; (2) self-assessed health and quality of life status; (3) physical/mental health impairment and disability; (4) healthcare access and utilisation; and (5) sociodemographic disparities in health and wellbeing. The gaps in this literature include a regional bias in research efforts, near absence of non-slum control samples, and limited research on the health impacts of the built environment of slums.

At this rate, the risk to the environment and health of inhabitants are enormous, because the current waste management practices are not guided by legislation on proper use and disposal. This paper proposes the conversion of waste to energy as a solution to this problem. The aim of this study is to apply the PROMETHEE technique with a combination weighting method to obtain the most appropriate waste-to-energy technology for the slum/informal settlements of the Greater Karu Urban area in Nigeria. The findings reveal that the gasification technology outperformed the other technologies, and the affordability of electricity supply from this technology was determined by a general survey conducted on the slum/informal settlements.","disorderly, disorganised, filthy,dirty,impoverished,marginalised, congested settlements,infrastructural scarcity",Negative,No,-,No,Descriptive,Conceptualization of slums,"planning, policy gaps, land tenure",Slum upgrading,-,,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/en15103481

Slum policies are influenced by the use of technologies, defined in this paper both as accounting techniques that stabilise the representations of informality and as technological artefacts used as means of intervention. Results show that the representations of slums used in the policies analysed contribute to the reproduction of informality by (i) representing slums as places of uncertainty and uncontrollability, (ii) affirming the need of experts and technical knowledge to correct the material, legal and knowledge deficits through which slums are represented, and (iii) focusing on the individual and household level and disregarding the relational character of poverty. These representations are influenced by sociotechnical imaginaries of sustainable and smart cities, through which the social orders that produce informality and social exclusion remain unquestioned.","disorderly, disorganised, filthy,dirty,impoverished,marginalised, congested settlements,infrastructural scarcity",Negative,No,-,No,Descriptive,Conceptualization of slums,"planning, policy gaps",-,-,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cities.2018.07.009

Slum settlements lack tenure security, posing an additional challenge for municipal and national governments in providing basic services. In particular, safe and affordable access to water for slum residents remains unmet, as slum settlements often lack municipal water supply coverage and rely on small-scale informal water services. We examined the dynamics between housing tenure status (tenancy vs ownership), water service types, and water insecurity among households in three slum settlements in Nairobi, Kenya. Using a cross-culturally validated 11-item Household Water Insecurity Experience (HWISE) scale, we identified a key link between housing tenure status and water insecurity, based on survey data from 556 households. We found that water insecurity in the study sites is a significant challenge because of the link between housing tenure and access to different water service types. As such, water insecurity scores among tenants were significantly higher than homeowners, and this association persists even after controlling for household characteristics. Furthermore, a higher percentage of homeowners had access to formal water services than tenants and accessing water from informal water providers was related to higher water insecurity. Our results highlight the need for development interventions in slums to consider housing tenure of residents when planning interventions to alleviate water insecurity. To meet the goal of â€˜equitable water for allâ€™ set by the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), governments must also take key steps to resolve housing tenure injustice and expand home ownership in slum settlements.","disorderly, disorganised, filthy,dirty,impoverished, insecure tenure, congested settlements,infrastructural scarcity",Negative,No,-,No,Descriptive,"Conceptualization of slums, marginalisation, sanitation, housing","planning, policy gaps, types of houses, land tenure","Slum upgrading,livelihood improvement",-,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.worlddev.2022.106165

Slum tourism is discussed as an emerging intervention to address the challenge of slums in the global south. Using ethnographic account and personal reflection of 5 slum settlements and key institutions in Lusaka, a novel approach is proposed: Absolute Slum Tourism (AST) and Relative Slum Tourism (RST), to contribute to the discourse on slum interventions. The study shows that navigating informal settlements through RST approach could significantly influence urban rejuvenation, empower local narratives, giving voice to the marginalised in slum communities and promoting equity. The paper further proposes a new framework for the co-creation of slum interventions, introducing a shift in how informal urban space and residents are perceived.","disorderly, disorganised, filthy,dirty,impoverished,marginalised, congested settlements,infrastructural scarcity",Negative,No,-,No,Descriptive,Conceptualization of slums,"policy gaps, planning,public health","Slum upgrading,livelihood improvement",-,,http://dx.doi.org/10.46222/ajhtl.19770720.387

These settlements often lack connections to municipal sewage systems due to various reasons, including issues related to land tenure and the official capacity to invest in infrastructure in unplanned areas. As a result, on-site decentralized sanitation is the norm for shack dwellings in Namibia, and any opposition to this system can lead to a lack of sanitation facilities and inadvertently promote open defecation. The study explores the challenges and opportunities in this gray area of urban informality, assessing the interactions between local communities, non-government organizations (specifically, the Clay House Project and Development Workshop Namibia), and an international development agency (GIZ) as they work together to implement bottom-up sanitation solutions for informal settlements in Namibia. The research involves a critical analysis of the different sanitation delivery models used by these organizations, considering their historical development, underlying philosophies, and technical solutions. It also investigates how products from various sanitation systems are managed and explores whether urine source separation could improve their overall management.
