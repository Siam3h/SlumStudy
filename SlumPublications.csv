It reveals the characteristics of slums and how these have changed over time. Spatially disaggregated data show that slum areas are very dense with poor-quality buildings, lacking access to key services such as sewage disposal and electricity. However, improvements to building quality, public-service provision, and socio-economic characteristics are mostly outpacing those seen in the formal sector. Measures such as child health and school attendance have caught up or are on pace to catch up in the near future with the formal sector, while improvements in building quality and service provision are advancing more slowly. We find significant heterogeneity across the city, and in particular that central slums look to be 'stuck' with low-quality buildings and poor service provision, though not with low socio-economic indicators. We explore potential explanations for why slums located on highly prized land near the centre may be stuck with poor infrastructure.","disorderly, disorganised, filthy,dirty,impoverished,marginalised, congested settlements,infrastructural scarcity",Negative,No,-,No,Descriptive,Conceptualization of slums,planning,"Improvement of life,livelihood improvement",-,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/oxrep/grx036

Almost one in seven people on the planet are expected to reside in urban informal settlements, or slums, by 2030. Slum upgrading is the process of delivering place-based environmental and social improvements to the urban poor, including land tenure, housing, infrastructure, employment, health services and political and social inclusion. The processes and products of slum upgrading can address multiple environmental determinants of health. This paper reviewed urban slum upgrading evaluations from cities across Asian, Africa and Latin Americann and found that few captured the multiple health benefits of upgrading. With the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) focused on improving well-being for billions of city-dwellers, slum upgrading should be viewed as a key strategy to promote health, equitable development and reduce climate change vulnerabilities. We conclude with suggestions for how slum upgrading might more explicitly capture its health benefits, such as through the use of health impact assessment (HIA) and adopting an urban health in all policies (HiAP) framework. Urban slum upgrading must be more explicitly designed, implemented and evaluated to capture its multiple global environmental health benefits.","disorderly, disorganised, filthy,dirty,impoverished,marginalised, congested settlements,infrastructural scarcity",Negative,No,-,No,Descriptive,Conceptualization of slums,planning,"Improvement of life,livelihood improvement",-,,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ijerph14040342

However, existing urban metabolic analyses exclude a detailed understanding of how urban slums function and contribute to biophysical, including energy, flows. This paper aims at filling this gap by critically investigating the notion of the urban slum in general, the extent to which it differs in the African context, specifically in South Africa, and broadening the understanding of urban slum based on the concept of urban metabolism, using the multi-scale integrated analysis of societal and ecosystem metabolism (MuSIASEM) approach, which was applied to the Enkanini informal settlement in Stellenbosch, South Africa. The analysis shows that South Africa has a more nuanced typology of the notion of urban slums categorised as: (i) townships; (ii) housing-turned-slum; (iii) squatter camps; (iv) site and service settlements; (v) transit camps; and (vi) hybrid multi-structured settlements. Beyond these definitions, the case study illustrates that urban slums, however defined, are complex systems with their own internal flows and processes that are connected in a myriad of ways to the larger urban system. The investigation into the use of Time, Money and Energy in the Enkanini case further revealed the productive (hypercyclic) and consumptive (dissipative) nature of the components of the urban informal settlement. This type of analysis reveals new insights into the linkages between urban informal settlements and the city.","disorderly, disorganised, filthy,dirty,impoverished,marginalised, congested settlements,infrastructural scarcity",Negative,No,-,No,Descriptive,Conceptualization of slums,planning,-,-,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cities.2016.12.018

This article talks about a study carried out in Kibera, the second largest slum in Africa located in Nairobi, Kenya, which examines how slums are morphologically constituted with respect to their socio-economic settings. The study stems from the authorâs several years of work as a community design architect on slum upgrading projects, many of which were of a participatory nature. Given that slums exist outside of formal planning and lack documented development records, a basic approach to studying slums was adopted. This article uses analogies to expound on the link between the spatial-temporal formation of the slum and the socio-economic activities and practices of its residents.

We searched 8 bibliographic databases for studies examining the health and wellbeing of older slum dwellers in the region. We also completed a grey literature search. The literature search together yielded 3,388 records, of which we selected 25 for review following a rigorous screening process. The included studies covered a variety of health issues of concern to older slum dwellers: (1) disease and injury prevalence; (2) self-assessed health and quality of life status; (3) physical/mental health impairment and disability; (4) healthcare access and utilisation; and (5) sociodemographic disparities in health and wellbeing. The gaps in this literature include a regional bias in research efforts, near absence of non-slum control samples, and limited research on the health impacts of the built environment of slums.

At this rate, the risk to the environment and health of inhabitants are enormous, because the current waste management practices are not guided by legislation on proper use and disposal. This paper proposes the conversion of waste to energy as a solution to this problem. The aim of this study is to apply the PROMETHEE technique with a combination weighting method to obtain the most appropriate waste-to-energy technology for the slum/informal settlements of the Greater Karu Urban area in Nigeria. The findings reveal that the gasification technology outperformed the other technologies, and the affordability of electricity supply from this technology was determined by a general survey conducted on the slum/informal settlements.","disorderly, disorganised, filthy,dirty,impoverished,marginalised, congested settlements,infrastructural scarcity",Negative,No,-,No,Descriptive,Conceptualization of slums,"planning, policy gaps, land tenure",Slum upgrading,-,,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/en15103481

Slum policies are influenced by the use of technologies, defined in this paper both as accounting techniques that stabilise the representations of informality and as technological artefacts used as means of intervention. Results show that the representations of slums used in the policies analysed contribute to the reproduction of informality by (i) representing slums as places of uncertainty and uncontrollability, (ii) affirming the need of experts and technical knowledge to correct the material, legal and knowledge deficits through which slums are represented, and (iii) focusing on the individual and household level and disregarding the relational character of poverty. These representations are influenced by sociotechnical imaginaries of sustainable and smart cities, through which the social orders that produce informality and social exclusion remain unquestioned.","disorderly, disorganised, filthy,dirty,impoverished,marginalised, congested settlements,infrastructural scarcity",Negative,No,-,No,Descriptive,Conceptualization of slums,"planning, policy gaps",-,-,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cities.2018.07.009

Slum settlements lack tenure security, posing an additional challenge for municipal and national governments in providing basic services. In particular, safe and affordable access to water for slum residents remains unmet, as slum settlements often lack municipal water supply coverage and rely on small-scale informal water services. We examined the dynamics between housing tenure status (tenancy vs ownership), water service types, and water insecurity among households in three slum settlements in Nairobi, Kenya. Using a cross-culturally validated 11-item Household Water Insecurity Experience (HWISE) scale, we identified a key link between housing tenure status and water insecurity, based on survey data from 556 households. We found that water insecurity in the study sites is a significant challenge because of the link between housing tenure and access to different water service types. As such, water insecurity scores among tenants were significantly higher than homeowners, and this association persists even after controlling for household characteristics. Furthermore, a higher percentage of homeowners had access to formal water services than tenants and accessing water from informal water providers was related to higher water insecurity. Our results highlight the need for development interventions in slums to consider housing tenure of residents when planning interventions to alleviate water insecurity. To meet the goal of âequitable water for allâ set by the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), governments must also take key steps to resolve housing tenure injustice and expand home ownership in slum settlements.","disorderly, disorganised, filthy,dirty,impoverished, insecure tenure, congested settlements,infrastructural scarcity",Negative,No,-,No,Descriptive,"Conceptualization of slums, marginalisation, sanitation, housing","planning, policy gaps, types of houses, land tenure","Slum upgrading,livelihood improvement",-,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.worlddev.2022.106165

Slum tourism is discussed as an emerging intervention to address the challenge of slums in the global south. Using ethnographic account and personal reflection of 5 slum settlements and key institutions in Lusaka, a novel approach is proposed: Absolute Slum Tourism (AST) and Relative Slum Tourism (RST), to contribute to the discourse on slum interventions. The study shows that navigating informal settlements through RST approach could significantly influence urban rejuvenation, empower local narratives, giving voice to the marginalised in slum communities and promoting equity. The paper further proposes a new framework for the co-creation of slum interventions, introducing a shift in how informal urban space and residents are perceived.","disorderly, disorganised, filthy,dirty,impoverished,marginalised, congested settlements,infrastructural scarcity",Negative,No,-,No,Descriptive,Conceptualization of slums,"policy gaps, planning,public health","Slum upgrading,livelihood improvement",-,,http://dx.doi.org/10.46222/ajhtl.19770720.387

These settlements often lack connections to municipal sewage systems due to various reasons, including issues related to land tenure and the official capacity to invest in infrastructure in unplanned areas. As a result, on-site decentralized sanitation is the norm for shack dwellings in Namibia, and any opposition to this system can lead to a lack of sanitation facilities and inadvertently promote open defecation. The study explores the challenges and opportunities in this gray area of urban informality, assessing the interactions between local communities, non-government organizations (specifically, the Clay House Project and Development Workshop Namibia), and an international development agency (GIZ) as they work together to implement bottom-up sanitation solutions for informal settlements in Namibia. The research involves a critical analysis of the different sanitation delivery models used by these organizations, considering their historical development, underlying philosophies, and technical solutions. It also investigates how products from various sanitation systems are managed and explores whether urine source separation could improve their overall management. The study provides valuable insights into addressing gaps in sanitation delivery in informal settlements, which are home to over a billion people worldwide.","Shack settlements,",Negative,No,United Nations 2022 World Population Prospects 2022,No,Descriptive,,Identification of Gaps in sanitary delivery,,,"van der Merwe, G., & Simha, P.

Contrary to the perception that the poor live hand-to-mouth, the book reveals that they employ a range of financial tools, often tied to informal networks and family connections. They engage in savings, borrowing, participate in savings clubs, and leverage microfinancing options. These strategies demonstrate innovative approaches to poverty alleviation and offer insights into shaping the future of banking for the world's most economically vulnerable populations.","Impoverished, family ties, inspiring",Negative,No,"Interviews,quastionnares",No,Descriptive,,strategies on innovative approaches to poverty alleviation and other insights,,,"Collins, D., Morduch, J., Rutherford, S., & Ruthven, O.

Design: The research was executed as a case-control study with a one-to-two design. A hypothetical causal model was developed for the undernutrition situation in Duncan Village. A questionnaire to assess the direct and underlying causes of growth failure in the study population was developed from this model. Subjects: One-hundred and fifty children were selected for the study, with 100 children in the control group and 50 children in the growth-failure group. Each child in the growth-failure group was matched with two children in the control group based on age and sex. The children were chosen according to anthropometric indices and p-albumin levels. Setting: The research was conducted at a primary health care centre in Duncan Village, an overpopulated urban slum area in East London, a small city on the east coast of South Africa. Results: No significant differences were found between the two groups for the occurrence of disease and infection. Dietary intake seemed to be generally poor in all the children. No significant differences were found between the two groups for the indicators of household food security, health service utilization and environmental conditions. The most important underlying determinants of growth failure that were identified in the study population seem to be related to the caring capacity, and the resultant caring behaviours of mothers. The risk for growth failure is increased when a child has a mother who is not the head of the household (relative risk) (RR = 4.3), who is not involved with the discipline of her children (RR = 2.2), who is not the guardian of the child (RR = 8), who was not born in Duncan Village or in a city (RR = 2.16), who is not able to write (RR=2.7) or read Xhosa (RR = 2.53), who has a school education of â¤ grade 9 (RR = 2.9), who did not receive nutrition education (RR = 2.2), who smokes (RR = 10) and drinks beer regularly (RR = 10), who has a BMI < 25 (RR = 2.7), who was subjectively judged to show little interest in her child (RR = 4) as well as an inadequate caring attitude towards her child (RR = 3.61), and whose clothing was dirty (RR = 2.7) and not tidy (RR = 2.9). Further determinants included the following: a child who weighed < 2500 g at birth (RR = 4.96), who had not received supplemental milk while still breast-fed (RR = 2.00), who did not receive baby cereal as first food (RR = 2.6), whose clothes (RR = 2.7) were dirty and whose hands were infrequently washed (RR = 10). Conclusions: The results of this research suggest that initiatives to address the problem of growth failure in 12-24-month-old children attending the Duncan Village Day Hospital should focus mainly on improving the caring capacity of mothers in the study area.","disorderly, disorganised, filthy,dirty,impoverished,marginalised, congested settlements,infrastructural scarcity",Negative,No,-,No,Descriptive,Conceptualization of slums,"policy gaps, planning,public health",-,-,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/sj.ejcn.1601500

578,II,SIAMA PHILBERT,Journal,Quality of water the slum dwellers use: The case of a Kenyan slum,"Kimani-Murage EW,Ngindu AM",Slums,2007,African,African,Abstract,"As a result of rapid urbanization in a context of economic constraints, the majority of urban residents in sub-Saharan Africa live in slums often characterized by a lack of basic services such as water and sewerage. Consequently, the urban poor often use inexpensive pit latrines and at the same time may draw domestic water from nearby wells. Overcrowding in slums limits the adequate distance between wells and pit latrines so that micro-organisms migrate from latrines to water sources. Sanitary practices in these overcrowded slums are also poor, leading to contamination of these wells. This study sought to assess sanitary practices of residents of a Kenyan urban slum and fecal contamination of their domestic water sources. This cross-sectional study involved 192 respondents from Langas slum, Kenya. Forty water samples were collected from the water sources used by the respondents for laboratory analysis of coliforms. Of these 40 samples, 31 were from shallow wells, four from deep wells, and five from taps. Multiple-tube fermentation technique was used to enumerate coliform bacteria in water. The study found that most people (91%) in the Langas slum used wells as the main source of domestic water, whereas the rest used tap water. Whereas most people used pit latrines for excreta disposal, a substantial percentage (30%) of children excreted in the open field. The estimated distance between the pit latrines and the wells was generally short with about 40% of the pit latrines being less than 15 m from the wells. The main domestic water sources were found to be highly contaminated with fecal matter. Total coliforms were found in 100% of water samples from shallow wells, while 97% of these samples from shallow wells were Positive for thermotolerant coliforms. Three out of the four samples from deep wells were Positive for total coliforms, while two of the four samples were Positive for thermotolerant coliforms. None of the samples from taps were Positive for either total or thermotolerant coliforms. Because the presence of thermotolerant coliforms in water indicates fecal contamination, facilitated by the proximity between the wells and pit latrines, the study suggests that the pit latrines were a major source of contamination of the wells with fecal matter. However, contamination through surface runoff during rains is also plausible as indiscriminate excreta disposal particularly by children was also common. Owing to the fecal contamination, there is a high possibility of the presence of disease pathogens in the water; thus, the water from the wells in Langas may not be suitable for human consumption. To address this problem, treatment of the water at community or household level and intensive behavioral change in sanitary practices are recommended. Efforts should be made to provide regulated tap water to this community and to other slums in sub-Saharan Africa where tap water is not accessible. However, more sampling of different water sources is recommended.

We find that efforts to regularize land titles to confer de jure security of tenure have not been encouraging. By contrast, infrastructure investment efforts have performed better - they have conferred de facto security of tenure and also ameliorated living conditions. Over time project-based learning and microlevel innovations have helped improve upgrading performance. To create broader and sustainable benefits, however, upgrading needs to go to scale. We propose an upgrading strategy with the following elements - a programmatic approach that links slums to citywide systems, is channelled through government, and combines a community-demand and participation approach with supply-side constraints and rules of access.","disorderly, disorganised, filthy,dirty,impoverished,marginalised, congested settlements,infrastructural scarcity",Negative,No,-,No,Descriptive,Conceptualization of slums,planning,Slum upgrading,-,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1068/c4p

Re-infection was assessed at 4-6 and 12 months post-treatment. The baseline prevalences of A. lumbricoides and T. trichiura were 81.7%-96.3% and 54.5%-86.2%, respectively, and the corresponding geometric mean intensities were 960 and 91 eggs/g faeces. Most (85%) of the children found infected with A. lumbricoides and 23% of those found infected with T. trichiura had moderate-heavy infections. A few of the children investigated had intensities of Ascaris and Trichuris infection that were considerably higher than those previously recorded in South Africa. The baseline prevalences of hookworm infection (0%-20% in individual slums, with a mean of 4.7%) and intensities of such infection (geometric mean=17 eggs/g) were relatively low. Albendazole proved very effective against A. lumbricoides and hookworm but less so against T. trichiura. Re-infection by A. lumbricoides and T. trichiura reached pre-treatment prevalences by 4-6 months post-treatment in some of the slums and by 12 months in all the other slums. By 12 months post-treatment, the intensities of A. lumbricoides infection had reached their pretreatment levels while those of T. trichiura infection were higher than at baseline. Approximately 50% of children had moderate-heavy T. trichiura infections at 12 months post-treatment compared with approximately 23% at baseline. Hookworm infections did not re-appear after treatment. The results show clearly that urban slums should be included in any future helminth-control programmes in South Africa.

Statistics means such as principal component analysis, regression analysis and prediction methods are used. Among slum persistence explanatory variables at national level, GDP, urbanization, life satisfaction index, debt burden and existing slum patterns emerge as prominent factors. One of the key messages of this study is that sustainable urbanization programs should address the causes, not only symptoms of slums at national level.","disorderly, disorganised, filthy,dirty,impoverished,marginalised, congested settlements,infrastructural scarcity",Negative,No,-,No,Diagnostic,Conceptualization of slums,"policy gaps, planning,public health",Slum upgrading,-,,

The urban character of the HIV epidemic in sub-Saharan Africa exacerbates concern about the urbanisation-poverty relationship. Recent empirical work has linked urban poverty, and particularly slum residence, to risky sexual behaviour in Kenya's capital city, Nairobi. This paper explores the generalisability of these assertions about the relationship between urban poverty and sexual behaviour using Demographic and Health Survey data from five African cities: Accra (Ghana), Dar-es-Salaam (Tanzania), Harare (Zimbabwe), Kampala (Uganda) and Nairobi (Kenya). The study affirms that, although risky behaviour varies across the five cities, slum residents demonstrate riskier sexual behaviour compared with non-slum residents. There is earlier sexual debut, lower condom usage and more multiple sexual partners among women residing in slum households regardless of setting, suggesting a relatively uniform effect of urban poverty on sexual risk behaviour.

628,II,SIAMA PHILBERT,Journal,Barriers to formal emergency obstetric care services' utilization,"Essendi H,Mills S,Fotso JC",Slums,2011,African,African,Abstract,"Access to appropriate health care including skilled birth attendance at delivery and timely referrals to emergency obstetric care services can greatly reduce maternal deaths and disabilities, yet women in sub-Saharan Africa continue to face limited access to skilled delivery services. This study relies on qualitative data collected from residents of two slums in Nairobi, Kenya in 2006 to investigate views surrounding barriers to the uptake of formal obstetric services. Data indicate that slum dwellers prefer formal to informal obstetric services. However, their efforts to utilize formal emergency obstetric care services are constrained by various factors including ineffective health decision making at the family level, inadequate transport facilities to formal care facilities and insecurity at night, high cost of health services, and inhospitable formal service providers and poorly equipped health facilities in the slums. As a result, a majority of slum dwellers opt for delivery services offered by traditional birth attendants (TBAs) who lack essential skills and equipment, thereby increasing the risk of death and disability. Based on these findings, we maintain that urban poor women face barriers to access of formal obstetric services at family, community, and health facility levels, and efforts to reduce maternal morbidity and mortality among the urban poor must tackle the barriers, which operate at these different levels to hinder women's access to formal obstetric care services. We recommend continuous community education on symptoms of complications related to pregnancy and timely referral. A focus on training of health personnel on ""public relations"" could also restore confidence in the health-care system with this populace. Further, we recommend improving the health facilities in the slums, improving the services provided by TBAs through capacity building as well as involving TBAs in referral processes to make access to services timely. Measures can also be put in place to enhance security in the slums at night.

The objectives of this study were to determine the vaccination status of children aged between 12-23 months living in two slums of Nairobi and to identify the risk factors associated with incomplete vaccination. Methods: The study was carried out as part of a longitudinal Maternal and Child Health study undertaken in Korogocho and Viwandani slums of Nairobi. These slums host the Nairobi Urban Health and Demographic Surveillance System (NUHDSS) run by the African Population and Health Research Centre (APHRC). All women from the NUHDSS area who gave birth since September 2006 were enrolled in the project and administered a questionnaire which asked about the vaccination history of their children. For the purpose of this study, we used data from 1848 children aged 12-23 months who were expected to have received all the WHO-recommended vaccinations. The vaccination details were collected during the first visit about four months after birth with follow-up visits repeated thereafter at four month intervals. Full vaccination was defined as receiving all the basic childhood vaccinations by the end of 24 months of life, whereas up-to-date (UTD) vaccination referred to receipt of BCG, OPV 1-3, DTP 1-3, and measles vaccinations within the first 12 months of life. All vaccination data were obtained from vaccination cards which were sighted during the household visit as well as by recall from mothers. Multivariate models were used to identify the risk factors associated with incomplete vaccination. Results: Measles coverage was substantially lower than that for the other vaccines when determined using only vaccination cards or in addition to maternal recall. Up-to-date (UTD) coverage with all vaccinations at 12 months was 41.3% and 51.8% with and without the birth dose of OPV, respectively. Full vaccination coverage (57.5%) was higher than up-to-date coverage (51.8%) at 12 months overall, and in both slum settlements, using data from cards. Multivariate analysis showed that household assets and expenditure, ethnicity, place of delivery, mother's level of education, age and parity were all predictors of full vaccination among children living in the slums. Conclusions: The findings show the extent to which children resident in slums are underserved with vaccination and indicate that service delivery of immunization services in the urban slums needs to be reassessed to ensure that all children are reached.

Although emerging research has focused on how slum residence is linked to risky behavior, there is a paucity of work on how migration to slums is related to risky sex. Using a sample of sexually active women from the 2000 Nairobi Cross-Sectional Slum Survey (NCSS), this paper demonstrates that the relationship between slum residence and risky behavior is a multifaceted one. Beyond the effect of current residence in slums migratory factors, specifically previous place of residence and length of time since arrival, prove to be significant cofactors, with the effect of the former conditioned by the latter. Perhaps more importantly, where migrants moved from appears to influence risky behavior in a non-uniform manner.

It focuses on the prevalence and severity of hunger and food insecurity in low-income urban settings, with a particular emphasis on sub-Saharan Africa. The paper proposes the use of one- and two-parameter item response theory models to develop a reliable and valid measure of hunger and food insecurity. The study draws evidence from the Nairobi Urban Health and Demographic Surveillance System to examine the accuracy and reliability of the items through Mokken scale analysis and the Cronbach test. Additionally, the paper assesses the validity of the inferred household food insecurity measure by exploring its association with households' economic status. The results reveal a grim picture of pervasive food insecurity, with only a fraction of households being food-secure, and a significant portion experiencing both adult and child hunger. The article provides a Diagnostic assessment of the issue in urban settings, highlighting its extent and severity, and offers a theoretical framework using item response theory models to measure and understand food insecurity in low-income urban areas.","filthy,dirty,impoverished,marginalised, infrastructural scarcity, malnutritioned",Negative,No,"sampling, interviewing",No,Diagnostic,"nutrition, conceptualization of slums","policy gaps, planning,public health",-,-,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11524-010-9521-x

We set out to compare incidence of typhoid fever in a densely populated urban slum and a rural community in Kenya, hypothesizing higher rates in the urban area, given crowding and suboptimal access to safe water, sanitation and hygiene. Methods: During 2007-9, we conducted population-based surveillance in Kibera, an urban informal settlement in Nairobi, and in Lwak, a rural area in western Kenya. Participants had free access to study clinics; field workers visited their homes biweekly to collect information about acute illnesses. In clinic, blood cultures were processed from patients with fever or pneumonia. Crude and adjusted incidence rates were calculated. Results: In the urban site, the overall crude incidence of Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi (S. Typhi) bacteremia was 247 cases per 100,000 person-years of observation (pyo) with highest rates in children 5-9 years old (596 per 100,000 pyo) and 2-4 years old (521 per 100,000 pyo). Crude overall incidence in Lwak was 29 cases per 100,000 pyo with low rates in children 2-4 and 5-9 years old (28 and 18 cases per 100,000 pyo, respectively). Adjusted incidence rates were highest in 2-4 year old urban children (2,243 per 100,000 pyo) which were >15-fold higher than rates in the rural site for the same age group. Nearly 75% of S. Typhi isolates were multi-drug resistant. Conclusions: This systematic urban slum and rural comparison showed dramatically higher typhoid incidence among urban children <10 years old with rates similar to those from Asiann urban slums. The findings have potential policy implications for use of typhoid vaccines in increasingly urban Africa.","filthy,dirty,impoverished,marginalised, congested settlements,infrastructural scarcity, disorderly, disorganised,",Negative,No,"sampling, interviewing",No,Diagnostic,"conceptualization of slums, health concerns","policy gaps, planning,public health, types of houses","slum upgrading, livelihood improvement",-,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0029119
650,II,SIAMA PHILBERT,Journal,Outward Migration from Large Cities: Are Older Migrants in Nairobi 'Returning'?,"Falkingham J,Chepngeno-Langat G,Evandrou M",Slums,2012,African,African,Abstract,"Circular and return migrations between rural and urban areas in sub-Saharan Africa have persisted over time, driven by a combination of socio-cultural, economic, and structural forces. Much of the literature on migration in Africa focuses on labour migration. However, old age also marks a stage in the life course often associated with migration. This paper examined the determinants of out-migration among older people living in the slums of Nairobi. The paper used a prospective population study of 2,270 older people, followed up over a 3-year period. The annual rate of out-migration was 4%. Cox proportional hazard analysis was used to model the effect of ties to place and to socio-economic capital on propensity to out-migrate. The presence of adult children outside the city was a significant pull factor for both men and women. The propensity to out-migrate decreased with length of residence in the slum. Attachment to the slum through participation in voluntary communal activities was also negatively associated with out-migration, particularly for men. The poorest older people were more likely to leave the city, highlighting the effect of deprivation in triggering return migration. Looking at future migration intentions, only one in five older people reported that they intend to relocate from the slums, highlighting that, in the future, there will be a growing number of people ageing 'in situ' in poor urban areas. This has implications for policy makers concerned with the provision of services to vulnerable older people who may be unable to engage in livelihood strategies as health deteriorates with age.

The number of youth who live on the streets and in the slums of Kampala appears to be growing rapidly, but their mental health needs have not been documented, which has hampered resource allocation and service implementation. This study of youth, ages 14-24, was conducted in May and June of 2011, to assess the prevalence and correlates of suicidal behavior. Participants (N = 457) were recruited for a 30-minute interviewer-administered survey through eight drop-in centers operated by the Uganda Youth Development Link for youth in need of services. Bivariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were computed to determine associations between psychosocial correlates and suicide ideation and suicide attempt. Reporting both parents deceased Adj.OR = 2.36; 95% CI: 1.23-4.52), parental neglect due to alcohol use (Adj.OR = 2.09; 95% CI: 1.16-3.77), trading sex for food, shelter or money (Adj.OR = 1.95; 95% CI: 1.09-3.51), sadnesss (Adj.OR = 2.42; 95% CI: 1.20-4.89), loneliness (Adj.OR = 2.67; 95% CI: 1.12-6.40) and expectations of dying prior to age 30 (Adj.OR = 2.54; 95% CI: 1.53-4.23) were significantly associated with suicide ideation in multivariate analyses. Parental neglect due to alcohol use (Adj.OR = 2.04; 95% CI: 1.11-3.76), sadness (Adj.OR = 2.42; 95% CI: 1.30-7.87), and expectations of dying prior to age 30 (Adj.OR = 2.18; 95% CI: 1.25-3.79) were significantly associated with suicide attempt in multivariate analyses. Given the dire circumstances of this vulnerable population, increased services and primary prevention efforts to address the risk factors for suicidal behavior are urgently needed.

This issue is analyzed through a case study of grassroots mobilization around evictions in Kurasini ward, Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. The paper uses an analytic narrative approach to account for patterns in participatory behaviour, drawing on both quantitative and qualitative data gathered through interviews with 81 slum dwellers. The study shows that, contrary to the expectations of movement leaders, property owners were significantly more likely than renters to participate in a risky and time-consuming mobilization effort. The study identifies three factors that favoured owner participation: the nature of expected payoffs from participation; greater belief in their efficacy of action; and greater connection to place.

For example, in East Africa, 48 % of children under-five are stunted while 36 % are underweight. Poor health and poor nutrition are now more a characteristic of children living in the urban areas than of children in the rural areas. This is because the protective mechanism offered by the urban advantage in the past; that is, the health benefits that historically accrued to residents of cities as compared to residents in rural settings is being eroded due to increasing proportion of urban residents living in slum settings. This study sought to determine effect of mother's education on child nutritional status of children living in slum settings.Methods: Data are from a maternal and child health project nested within the Nairobi Urban Health and Demographic Surveillance System (NUHDSS). The study involves 5156 children aged 0-42 months. Data on nutritional status used were collected between October 2009 and January 2010. We used binomial and multiple logistic regression to estimate the effect of education in the univariable and multivariable models respectively.Results: Results show that close to 40 % of children in the study are stunted. Maternal education is a strong predictor of child stunting with some minimal attenuation of the association by other factors at maternal, household and community level. Other factors including at child level: child birth weight and gender; maternal level: marital status, parity, pregnancy intentions, and health seeking behaviour; and household level: social economic status are also independently significantly associated with stunting.Conclusion: Overall, mothers' education persists as a strong predictor of child's nutritional status in urban slum settings, even after controlling for other factors. Given that stunting is a strong predictor of human capital, emphasis on girl-child education may contribute to breaking the poverty cycle in urban poor settings.

The tourist gaze at the poverty of the Others is long established, though. This paper is concerned with the genesis of urban poverty tourism. By placing the phenomenon of slumming in the wider realm of the social upheavals in Victorian London and early twentieth century USA, the historical review first explains its dependency on the social context determining its emergence and evolution. Secondly, slum tourism is shown to be adequately understood only if seen as part of modern city tourism. Thirdly, it is demonstrate that the culturalization of poverty attains special significance in slum tourism. Fourthly, the history of slum tourism is shown to have implications for understanding present-day slum tourism in the Global South, using South Africa as an example. The article is designed to be a first step towards understanding the conditions, forms and consequences of globalization of slum tourism and the process of constructing the global slum as a universal type of tourist destination.

Slums are emerging as dominant informal settlements in many cities of the Sub- Saharan Africa, The need for housing is physiological, As it serves as an abode for almost all human activities in that even those who cannot afford still need them, hence, Slum is one of the great challenge of housing facing metropolitan Lagos which resulted basically as a result of large scale migration from rural â urban migration. Slums are fast becoming major spatial manifestations of urbanization and poverty as a result of the continuous influx of people, especially the poor into Lagos metropolis. About eight per cent of African populations had no homes and more than half of African urban dwellers lacked one of the five basic conditions required for a decent housing like water supply, adequate sanitation, durable housing, adequate living space and secure tenure. This study contextually discusses this urban phenomenon and vital causes of rapid urbanization, aftermath of these actions. It also shows the extent to which the poor are deprived access to decent and affordable housing. The methodology employed for this study is literature search and case study. It focuses on Ajegunle slums in Lagos, Finally the paper concludes by suggesting recommendations that will also help to provide adequate shelter for the urban poor and urban homeless people in Lagos.

The analysis highlights the neoliberal principles underpinning this initiative, and especially the vision of slum improvement by means of financialisation. The article argues that it is necessary and important to recognise the politics of international urban development and housing, which has since the 1970s increasingly emphasised neoliberal principles of private property and market institutions. The novel ambition of financialisation must also be situated in relation to historical transformations of housing finance in Anglo-Africann capitalism over the past three decades. After situating the ideological principles underpinning the Slum Upgrading Facility in these longer and broader global trajectories of international policy, the final section returns to the present to examine other initiatives currently being pursued alongside slum upgrading: the active promotion of mortgage markets in Africa.

In Africa, available studies are scarce, and the relevance of this disease paradigm is questionable. Cholera outbreaks have been repeatedly reported far from the coasts: from 2009 through 2011, three-quarters of all cholera cases in Africa occurred in inland regions. Such outbreaks are either influenced by rainfall and subsequent floods or by drought-and water-induced stress. Their concurrence with global climatic events has also been observed. In lakes and rivers, aquatic reservoirs of Vibrio cholerae have been evocated. However, the role of these reservoirs in cholera epidemiology has not been established. Starting from inland cholera-endemic areas, epidemics burst and spread to various environments, including crowded slums and refugee camps. Human displacements constitute a major determinant of this spread. Further studies are urgently needed to better understand these complex dynamics, improve water and sanitation efforts, and eliminate cholera from Africa.

It is based on a cross-sectional study comparing two slum communities in East Africa, where 250 households from Bwaise III in Kampala, Uganda and 379 households from Temeke in Dar es Sa-laam, Tanzania were interviewed in 2010. Also, 10 key-informant interviews and 8 focus group discussions were conducted in addition to field observations. Findings show that majority (85%) of households used unimproved, private-shared pit latrines. These privately owned latrines had many structural shortfalls besides poor opera-tion and maintenance while the public latrines provided by third-party were structurally sound but were underutilized in residential slum neigh-borhoods. This is attributed to the presence free or at least cheaper alternatives which the com-munity members preferred instead of paying per-visit user-fees. For the few who were willing to pay, willingness to pay was Positively asso-ciated with the presence of a facility User com-mittee and having been sensitized. In this con-text, a combination of these factors made cost recovery as well as operation and maintenance very minimal. The poor status of privately owned shared pit latrines matched the limited income levels of households. Similarly, cost recovery for public facilities was dependent on the num-ber of users who were willing to pay: the more the users, the more the cost recovery. A combi-nation of private and public financing is thus necessary to fund different but complementary aspects of sanitation in slums.","disorderly, disorganised, filthy,dirty,impoverished,marginalised, congested settlements,infrastructural scarcity",Negative,No,-,No,Diagnostic,Conceptualization of slums,"policy gaps, planning,public health",-,-,,http://dx.doi.org/10.4236/health.2013.54104
677,II,SIAMA PHILBERT,Journal,A successful slum upgrade in Durban: A case of formal change andinformal continuity,Patel K,Slums,2013,Asian,Asian,Abstract,"In situ slum upgrades implemented through community participation are widely considered global best practice in efforts to significantly improve the lives of at least 100 million shack dwellers. This paper scrutinises the process and impact of community participation in a slum upgrade in Durban. Based on data from an ethnographic study of Zwelisha, a newly upgraded settlement north of Durban, South Africa, this paper presents a nuanced analysis of the upgrade process and the role of community participation in achieving successful outcomes in terms of significant improvement to tenure security and wellbeing (as defined by Zwelisha's residents). The analysis shows that successful outcomes are intrinsically tied to the manner in which the upgrade process is implemented. The paper argues the formal changes that result in successful outcomes are possible only because of informal continuities; specifically, the continued and consolidated power and influence of the local community development committee following upgrade. While the paper frames the continuity of informal power relations as important to successful outcomes for wellbeing, the findings can also be read as a tale of caution of how the state's approach to community participation in slum upgrades may consolidate and legitimise informal power relations that may not be necessarily benevolent.

Health strategies that focus on non-communicable diseases (NCD) in this segment of the population are generally lacking. We determined the prevalence of diabetes and associated cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors correlates in Kibera, Nairobi's largest slum. Methods. We conducted a population-based household survey utilising cluster sampling with probability proportional to size. Households were selected using a random walk method and consenting residents aged 18 years and above were recruited. The WHO STEPS instrument was administered. A random capillary blood sugar (RCBS) was obtained; known persons with diabetes and subjects with a RCBS >11.1 had an 8 hours fasting blood sugar (FBS) drawn. Diabetes was defined as a RCBS of â¥ 11.1 mmol/l and a FBS of â¥ 7.0 mmol/l, or a prior diagnosis or receiving diabetes drug treatment. Results: Out of 2061 enrolled; 50.9% were males, mean age was 33.4 years and 87% had a minimum of primary education. Only 10.6% had ever had a blood sugar measurement. Age adjusted prevalence of diabetes was 5.3% (95% CI 4.2-6.4) and prevalence increased with age peaking at 10.5% (95% CI 6.8-14.3%) in the 45-54 year age category. Diabetes mellitus (DM) correlates were: 13.1% smoking, 74.9% alcohol consumption, 75.7% high level of physical activity; 16.3% obese and 29% overweight with higher rates in women.Among persons with diabetes the odds of obesity, elevated waist circumference and hypertension were three, two and three fold respectively compared to those without diabetes. Cardiovascular risk factors among subjects with diabetes were high and mirrored that of the entire sample; however they had a significantly higher use of tobacco. Conclusions: This previously unstudied urban slum has a high prevalence of DM yet low screening rates. Key correlates include cigarette smoking and high alcohol consumption. However high levels of physical activity were also reported. Findings have important implications for NCD prevention and care. For this rapidly growing youthful urban slum population policy makers need to focus their attention on strategies that address not just communicable diseases but non communicable diseases as well.

Urban informal (slum) settlements in sub-Saharan Africa are marked by extreme adversity. However, the prevalence and consequences of adverse life events as well as protective factors that can mitigate the effects of exposure to these events in slum settlements is largely understudied. We examine two research questions. First, are adverse life events experienced at the individual and household level associated with a higher likelihood of delinquent behavior among adolescents living in two slums in Nairobi, Kenya? Second, are parental monitoring, religiosity, and self-esteem protective against delinquency in a context of high adversity?Methods: We used cross-sectional data from 3,064 males and females aged 12-19 years who participated in the Transitions to Adulthood Study. We examined the extent to which a composite index of adverse life events was associated with delinquent behavior (measured using a composite index derived from nine items). We also examined the direct and moderating effects of three protective factors: parental monitoring, religiosity, and self-esteem.Results: Fifty-four percent of adolescents reported at least one adverse life event, while 18% reported three or more adverse events. For both males and females, adversity was Positively and significantly associated with delinquency in bivariate and multivariate models. Negative associations were observed between the protective factors and delinquency. Significant adverse events Ã protective factor interaction terms were observed for parental monitoring (females and males), religiosity (males), and self-esteem (females).Conclusions: Similar to research in high income countries, adverse life events are associated with an increased likelihood of delinquent behavior among adolescents living in urban slums in Kenya, a low-income country. However, parental monitoring, religiosity, and self-esteem may moderate the effect of adversity on delinquent behavior and pinpoint possible avenues to develop interventions to reduce delinquency in resource-poor settings in low and middle income countries.","disorderly, disorganised, filthy,dirty,impoverished,marginalised, congested settlements,infrastructural scarcity",Negative,Yes,-,No,Diagnostic,Conceptualization of slums,"planning, policy gaps, land tenure",-,-,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/1753-2000-8-24

Methods and Results: A quantitative microbial risk assessment (QMRA) was carried out to determine the magnitude of microbial risks from waterborne pathogens through various exposure pathways in Bwaise III in Kampala (Uganda). This was based on the concentration of Escherichia coli O157:H7, Salmonella spp., rotavirus (RV) and human adenoviruses F and G (HAdV) in spring water, tap water, surface water, grey water and contaminated soil samples. The total disease burden was 680 disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) per 1000 persons per year. The highest disease burden contribution was caused by exposure to surface water open drainage channels (39%) followed by exposure to grey water in tertiary drains (24%), storage containers (22%), unprotected springs (8%), contaminated soil (7%) and tap water (0Â·02%). The highest percentage of the mean estimated infections was caused by E. coli O157:H7 (41%) followed by HAdV (32%), RV (20%) and Salmonella spp. (7%). In addition, the highest infection risk was 1 caused by HAdV in surface water at the slum outlet, while the lowest infection risk was 2Â·71 Ã 10-6 caused by E. coli O157:H7 in tap water. Conclusions: The results show that the slum environment is polluted, and the disease burden from each of the exposure routes in Bwaise III slum, with the exception of tap water, was much higher than the WHO reference level of tolerable risk of 1 Ã 10-6 DALYs per person per year. Significance and Impact of the Study: The findings of this study provide guidance to governments, local authorities and nongovernment organizations in making decisions on measures to reduce infection risk and the disease burden by 102 to 105 depending on the source of exposure to achieve the desired health impacts. The infection risk may be reduced by sustainable management of human excreta and grey water, coupled with risk communication during hygiene awareness campaigns at household and community level. The data also provide a basis to make strategic investments to improve sanitary conditions in urban slums.

However, people in Asian and Africa were the least likely to perceive global warming as a threat. In Vietnam, little research has been conducted concerning the perceptions of effects of climate change on human health. Objective: The aim of this study was to explore the perceptions on climate change and its impact on human health among people in Hanoi. Design: We applied a combined quantitative and qualitative approach to study perceptions on climate change among people in Hanoi. A total of 1,444 people were recruited, including 754 people living in non-slum areas and 690 people living in slum areas of Hanoi. A structured questionnaire was used to collect quantitative data on their perceptions. In a parallel qualitative study, two focus group discussions and 12 in-depth interviews (IDs) were carried out involving 24 people from both slum and non-slum areas. Results: The majority of the respondents in the study had heard about climate change and its impact on human health (79.3 and 70.1% in non-slum and slum areas, respectively). About one third of the respondents reported that members of their family had experienced illness in the recent summer and winter compared to the same seasons 5 years ago. The most common symptoms reported during hot weather were headaches, fatigue, and dizziness; hypertension and other cardiovascular diseases were also reported. During cold weather, people reported experiencing cough, fever, and influenza, as well as pneumonia and emerging infectious diseases such as dengue and Japanese encephalitis. Conclusions: The observed high level of awareness on the links between climate change and human health may help to increase the success of the National Prevention Program on Climate Change. Moreover, understanding the concerns of the people may help policy makers to develop and implement effective and sustainable adaptation measures for Hanoi City as well as for Vietnam as a whole.","disorderly, disorganised, filthy,dirty,impoverished,marginalised, congested settlements,infrastructural scarcity",Negative,Yes,-,No,Diagnostic,Conceptualization of slums,"policy gaps, planning,public health",-,-,,http://dx.doi.org/10.3402/gha.v7.23025

There are a number of innovative approaches to sanitation in developing countries. Private pit latrines still provide 85% of the sanitation solutions for households in the slums of Dar es Salaam and Kampala. A distinction is made between household and shared toilets. Small scale entrepreneurs, Community Based Organizations (CBOs) and Nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) build maintain and sometimes empty usually shared sanitary facilities in a situation where the government is not able to provide sanitary services. Household level and private sector solutions are common in sanitation and can be encouraged. The repayment mechanisms in slums in the capitals of Tanzania and Uganda, the current mechanisms of financing sanitary facilities and recovering the cost using different governance structures are analyzed. Solutions are suggested based on the current practices. Governments could recognize the importance of what we call household level or private solutions and support them, for example by promoting more appropriate governance structures, cost recovery systems and reorganizing the emptying system to bring down the cost of emptying and involving small scale producers. It is recommended to promote more appropriate financing and governance mechanisms in the sanitation sector.

Instead of surveying about stable urban symbols represented by formal orders and regular geometries, this study explores the semantic meaning of informal urbanism associated with chaos or randomness and often ignored by critique and conventions. Slums are forms of âinstant urbanityâ that underscore alternative ways of self-organisation, which include bottom-up strategies, autonomous urban dynamics and spatial activation by remaking. Are slum patterns representing a lack of symbolism or, on contrary, rich, complex, and fluid urban idioms? Urban informality without planning offers immense opportunities to investigate resilient urban forms and languages as complex systems throughout self-ruled structures. Slums are not only the result of urban economic asymmetries and social marginalisation but the elementary construction of survival urbanism, a randomised, agile and transformative pattern system. Slum making is a form of subsistence urbanity that constructs transitory, elusive or spontaneous geometries. They differ in sizes, magnitudes and geometries regarding cultural, climatic and topographic conditions. Slums are unstable systems in continuous transformation. This essay questions the stigmatisation of informalised urban patterns as âotherâ unclassified codes by analysing a selection of twenty mega-slums in the Africans, Africa and Asian regarding semantics, urban and geometrical meanings. Their urban tissues contain various symbols that activate the every-day production of spaces. They can be visible or invisible; passive or active; and formal or informal. A taxonomic tree of slums was developed to compare and map slum regions to describe similarities and differences among the selected case studies. From this analysis, a profound discourse appeared between informal settlements: tissue-patterns at macro level and cell-patterns in micro urbanisation. Does the macro pattern inform the micro, or vice versa?","disorderly, disorganised, filthy,dirty,impoverished,marginalised, congested settlements,infrastructural scarcity",Negative,Yes,-,No,Diagnostic,Conceptualization of slums,"policy gaps, planning,public health",-,-,,http://dx.doi.org/10.3846/20297955.2014.987368
703,II,SIAMA PHILBERT,Journal,Slum Tourism and Urban Regeneration: Touring Inner Johannesburg,Frenzel F,Slums,2014,African,African,Abstract,"Much attention has been paid to township tourism in South Africa, a practice of tourism that emerged in Apartheid South Africa with different organised tours catering for governmental officials, faith-based groups and anti-apartheid activists. In democratic South Africa, township tourism has developed into a mainstream tourism activity, and operators now offer township tours, township stays and other tourist activities in townships across rural and urban South Africa. Township tourism has also been one central empirical pillar of the relatively new research area of slum tourism, addressing tourism in slums and areas of relative urban poverty across the globe. Based on recent preliminary empirical research in Johannesburg, this paper shows that slum tourism can now also be observed in areas other than townships in South Africa, including perceived âno-go areasâ in inner-city Johannesburg. The expansion of slum tourism beyond townships in Johannesburg points to an increasingly complex picture of urban poverty in South Africa. It also allows reflections on the role of slum tourism in poverty alleviation and urban regeneration, responding to and addressing âterritorial stigmaâ and other related symbolic aspects of poverty. Analysing the motivations and perspectives of tour operators of some of these new tours, the paper finds that the new slum tourism in South Africa is pursued in order to serve as an urban development and regeneration tool from below. It responds to an absence of action or perceived failure to respond to poverty by urban policy, and its potential lies in particular in addressing invisibility, overcoming territorial stigma and empowerment of the urban poor.","disorderly, disorganised, filthy,dirty,impoverished,marginalised, congested settlements,infrastructural scarcity",Negative,Yes,-,No,Diagnostic,Conceptualization of slums,"policy gaps, planning,public health","Improvement of life,livelihood improvement",-,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12132-014-9236-2

These rural areas are presently the focus of government attention for tourism promotion as part of economic upgrading and employment creation. The key findings are that the expanding tourism economy of these rural slumlands is dominated by domestic tourists rather than international visitors with most tourists engaged in VFR travel including trips to rural second homes. In addition, these areas are important foci for religious pilgrimage. In terms of international scholarship on slum tourism the paper offers the significant observation that the largest share of tourists originate in the country's urban township areas which are the attractions for international slum tourists. The destinations for visits by international slum tourists are therefore the essential source regions of tourists for visits to the rural poverty areas or slumlands of South Africa. This points to an imperative for broadening the research agenda of slum tourism to incorporate research which examines the tourism mobilities of ordinary residents of townships or favelas.","disorderly, disorganised, filthy,dirty,impoverished,marginalised, congested settlements,infrastructural scarcity",Negative,Yes,-,No,Diagnostic,Conceptualization of slums,"policy gaps, planning,public health",-,-,,http://dx.doi.org/10.2478/bog-2014-0042

Three critical factors in urban slums of Southern and Eastern Africa - the region most affected by the HIV epidemic in the world - are unmet needs of housing, food, and health care, which are associated with HIV sexual risks. Yet, there has been limited attention on how the combination of unmet needs of housing, food, and health care - i.e., material deprivation - relates to sexual risk behavior among young people in urban slums. Cross-sectional data were extracted from the LoveLife survey in South African four provinces - KwaZulu Natal, Mpumalanga, Eastern Cape, and Gauteng, to examine the association between material deprivation and sexual risk behavior among young people aged 18-23 years (263 males, 267 females) in urban slums. Adjusted logistic regression models showed that material deprivation was significantly associated with increased odds of high sexual risk taking for young men (adjusted ORâ=â1.20; 95 % CIâ=â1.10, 5.58) and young women (adjusted ORâ=â1.43; 95 % CIâ=â1.35, 3.28). Financial difficulty - a proxy for other deprivations - was the most salient influence on young women's high sexual risk taking (adjusted ORâ=â2.11; 95 % CIâ=â1.66, 2.70).

Achieving target goals on this however remains a challenge in Sub-Saharan Africa. Kenya's infant mortality rates are higher than the global average and are more pronounced in urban areas as compared to rural areas. Only limited knowledge exists about the differences in individual level risk factors for infant death among rural, non-slum urban, and slum areas in Kenya. Therefore, this paper aims at 1) assess individual and socio-ecological risk factors for infant death in Kenya, and at 2) identify whether living in rural, non-slum urban, or slum areas moderated individual or socioecological risk factors for infant death in Kenya. Methodology: We used a cross-sectional study design based on the most recent Kenya Population and Housing Census of 2009 and extracted the records of all females who had their last child born in 12 months preceding the survey (N = 1,120,960). Multivariable regression analyses were used to identify risk factors that accounted for the risk of dying before the age of one at the individual level in Kenya. Place of residence (rural, non-slum urban, slum) was used as an interaction term to account for moderating effects in individual and socio-ecological risk factors. Results: Individual characteristics of mothers and children (older age, less previously born children that died, better education, girl infants) and household contexts (better structural quality of housing, improved water and sanitation, married household head) were associated with lower risk for infant death in Kenya. Living in non-slum urban areas was associated with significantly lower infant death as compared to living in rural or slum areas, when all predictors were held at their reference levels. Moreover, place of residence was significantly moderating individual level predictors: As compared to rural areas, living in urban areas was a protective factor for mothers who had previous born children who died, and who were better educated. However, living in urban areas also reduced the health promoting effects of better structural quality of housing (i.e. poor or good versus non-durable). Furthermore, durable housing quality in urban areas turned out to be a risk factor for infant death as compared to rural areas. Living in slum areas was also a protective factor for mothers with previous child death, however it also reduced the promoting effects of older ages in mothers. Conclusions: While urbanization and slum development continues in Kenya, public health interventions should invest in healthy environments that ideally would include improvements to access to safe water and sanitation, better structural quality of housing, and to access to education, health care, and family planning services, especially in urban slums and rural areas. In nonslum urban areas however, health education programs that target healthy diets and promote physical exercise may be an important adjunct to these structural interventions.

Relatively less attention is given to the world's poorest region, Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) where children and adolescents still comprise a high proportion of the population. Yet the number of adults aged 60-plus in SSA is already twice that in northern European. In addition, SSA is experiencing massive rural to urban migration with consequent expansion of informal urban settlements, or slums, whose health problems are usually unrecognised and not addressed. This study aims to improve understanding of functional health and well-being in older adult slum-dwellers in Nairobi (Kenya). Methods: The study sample comprised men and women, aged 50 years and over, living in Korogocho and Viwandani, Nairobi, Kenya (n = 1,878). Data from the International Network for the Demographic Evaluation of Populations and Their Health (INDEPTH) and the WHO Study on global AGEing and adult health (SAGE Wave 1) were analysed. The prevalence of poor self-reported quality of life (QoL) and difficulties in domain-specific function is estimated by age and sex. Logistic regression investigates associations between difficulties in the domains of function and poor QoL, adjusting for age, sex and socio-demographic factors. Statistical significance is set at P<0.05. Results: Women reported poorer QoL and greater functional difficulties than men in all domains except self-care. In the multivariable logistic regression the odds of poor QoL among respondents with problems or difficulties in relation to affect (OR = 7.0; 95%CI = 3.0-16.0), pain/discomfort (OR = 3.6; 95%CI = 2.3-5.8), cognition (OR = 1.8; 95 %CI = 1.2-2.9) and mobility (OR = 1.8; 95%CI = 1.1-2.8) were statistically significant. Conclusions: The findings underscore differences in the domains of functional health that encapsulate women and men's capacities to perform regular activities and the impact of poor functioning on QoL. Investing in the health and QoL of older people in SSA will be crucial in helping the region to realise key development goals and in opening opportunities for improved health outcomes and sustainable economic development.","disorderly, disorganised, filthy,dirty,impoverished,marginalised, congested settlements,infrastructural scarcity",Negative,Yes,-,No,Diagnostic,Conceptualization of slums,"planning, policy gaps",-,-,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12889-015-2556-x

Diabetes and hypertension, major risk factors for CVD, are highly prevalent among the urban poor in Africa, but treatment options are often limited in such settings. This study reports on the results of an intervention for the treatment of diabetes and hypertension for adult residents of two slums in Nairobi, Kenya. Methods: After setting up two clinics in two slums in Nairobi, hypertension and/or diabetes patients were seen by a clinician monthly. Socio-demographic characteristics and clinical data were collected over a 34-month period. Records were analyzed for 726 patients who visited the clinics at least once to determine clinic attendance and compliance patterns using survival analysis. We also examined changes in systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP) and random blood glucose (RBG) during the course of the program. Results: There was poor compliance with clinic attendance as only 3.4 % of patients attended the clinics on a regular (monthly) basis throughout the 34-month period. 75 % of hypertension patients were not compliant after four visits and 27 % of patients had only one clinic visit. Significant reduction of mean SBP and DBP (150.4 mmHg to 141.5 mmHg, P = .003, and 89.3 mmHg to 83.2 mmHg, P < .001) was seen for all patients that stayed in care for at least one year. Conclusions: Establishing a preventative care and treatment system in low resource settings for CVD is challenging due to high dropout rates and non-compliance. Innovative strategies are needed to ensure that benefits of treatment programs are sustained for long-term CVD risk reduction in poor urban populations.","disorderly, disorganised, filthy,dirty,impoverished,marginalised, congested settlements,infrastructural scarcity",Negative,Yes,-,No,Diagnostic,Conceptualization of slums,"planning, policy gaps, land tenure","Slum upgrading,livelihood improvement",-,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12913-015-1167-7

The four NCDs share four common risk factors. As most of the existing evidence on the common NCD risk factors is based on analysis of a single factor at a time, there is a need to investigate the co-occurrence of the common NCD risk factors, particularly in an urban slum setting in sub-Saharan Africa. Objective: To determine the prevalence of co-occurrence of the four common NCDs risk factors among urban slum dwellers in Nairobi, Kenya. Design: This analysis was based on the data collected as part of a cross-sectional survey to assess linkages among socio-economic status, perceived personal risk, and risk factors for cardiovascular and NCDs in a population of slum dwellers in Nairobi, Kenya, in 2008-2009. A total of 5,190 study subjects were included in the analysis. After selecting relevant variables for common NCD risk factors, we computed the prevalence of all possible combinations of the four common NCD risk factors. The analysis was disaggregated by relevant background variables. Results: The weighted prevalences of unhealthy diet, insufficient physical activity, harmful use of alcohol, and tobacco use were found to be 57.2, 14.4, 10.1, and 12.4%, respectively. Nearly 72% of the study participants had at least one of the four NCD risk factors. About 52% of the study population had any one of the four NCD risk factors. About one-fifth (19.8%) had co-occurrence of NCD risk factors. Close to one in six individuals (17.6%) had two NCD risk factors, while only 2.2% had three or four NCD risk factors. Conclusions: One out of five of people in the urban slum settings of Nairobi had co-occurrence of NCD risk factors. Both comprehensive and differentiated approaches are needed for effective NCD prevention and control in these settings.","disorderly, disorganised, filthy,dirty,impoverished,marginalised, congested settlements,infrastructural scarcity",Negative,Yes,-,No,Diagnostic,Conceptualization of slums,"policy gaps, planning,public health","slum upgrading, livelihood improvement",-,,http://dx.doi.org/10.3402/gha.v8.28697

Previous studies suggest a direct or Positive link between these variables. This revelation is considered counter-intuitive. Consequently, the study reported here hypothesized a negative or inverse relation between the variables at the inter-country level. The analysis uncovered evidence supporting the hypothesized link. The findings suggest as follows. Given two types of countries, 'A' and 'B,' where the former experienced more intense colonialism, while the latter was less intensively colonized, 'A' would have a lower incidence of slums than 'B.' Thus, the conclusion that colonialism is associated with less, and not more, slum incidence. This relationship, at least within the context of the study reported here, holds true whether colonialism is operationalized in terms of the duration of colonialism, the level of colonial investment or the extent of colonially-induced urbanization. The strongest predictor of slum incidence as revealed in the study is the duration of colonialism. The population size of the main colonial city in 1960 came in last as a predictor of this phenomenon.","disorderly, disorganised, filthy,dirty,impoverished,marginalised, congested settlements,infrastructural scarcity",Negative,Yes,-,No,Diagnostic,Conceptualization of slums,"policy gaps, planning,public health",-,-,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cities.2015.01.004

Currently, FS or its liquid fraction after dewatering is co-treated with sewage in conventional treatment plants. When dewatered, the solid stream is dried and stored further as the terminal treatment or is co-treated directly with organic solid wastes in composting or anaerobic digestion systems. To implement these, FS has to be collected and transported. Also, land is needed, but it is in most cases limited in slums or their vicinity. The collection and transport of FS from slums is costly due to lack of access, traffic congestion and long travel distances to treatment plants. Moreover, uncollected FS poses health risks and pollutes surface and/or ground water within slums. This review demonstrates that currently utilized technologies and practices fall short in various ways and discusses the possibility of minimizing FS management related costs, risks and pollution in urban slums by decentralized treatment and end-use. It also discusses the possible FS-derived end-products and their benefits to urban slum dwellers. Substitution of a part of natural materials (sand and clay) when building and/or biomass (firewood and charcoal) for cooking with FS derived end-products could multiply the benefits of improved sanitation to slum dwellers.","disorderly, disorganised, filthy,dirty,impoverished,marginalised, congested settlements,infrastructural scarcity",Negative,Yes,-,No,Diagnostic,Conceptualization of slums,planning,"Slum upgrading,livelihood improvement",-,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.resconrec.2015.09.001

People living with HIV and AIDS (PLWHA) die after succumbing to opportunistic infections, especially water-borne diseases (e.g., diarrhoea, cholera). This study was based on 485 individuals with HIV and AIDs drawn from three types of settlements (rural, peri-urban and urban slums) and sampled from three selected provincial districts of Khayelitsha (Western Cape), Ukhahlamba (Eastern Cape) and Groblersdal (Limpopo). The results show PLWHA having higher willingness-to-pay (WTP) for sanitation at ZAR448.40/month compared to water (ZAR428.60). Those living in urban slum settlements show the highest WTP for sanitation (ZAR552.70), followed by the ones in rural areas (ZAR500.24). The results underscore important implications: PLWHA face greater sanitation challenges relative to water; those in slum settlements endure the worst sanitation insecurity compared to counterparts living in other settlement types; higher WTP for sanitation implies that PLWHA will derive greater benefits from improvements in sanitation services relative to water. To conclude, it is imperative for municipal authorities to prioritize the provision of sanitation facilities to PLWHA especially in urban slums as part of the âpro-poor service deliveryâ campaigns.","disorderly, disorganised, filthy,dirty,impoverished,marginalised, congested settlements,infrastructural scarcity",Negative,Yes,-,No,Diagnostic,Conceptualization of slums,"planning, policy gaps, land tenure","Improvement of life,livelihood improvement",-,,http://dx.doi.org/10.2166/washdev.2016.102

Sodom and Gomorrah is a city slum located in the heart of Accra, Ghana. Like other slums, it lacks basic amenities necessary for dwellers' quality of life. This study describes residents' access to health and factors associated with the use of healthcare facilities. Methods: Questionnaires were administered in systematically selected Other across the entire slum. Data on demographic characteristics, existent health facilities and number of users, health-insured residents and knowledge of common diseases were collected. Results: Majority of the residents were from the northern parts of Ghana, relative to the south and a few of them come from other parts of West Africa. Seventy-one percent of residents had never visited a health facility in the last 5 years. When necessary, they access health care from drug stores (61.1%) or hospitals (33.1%). Residents' age, educational status, income, health knowledge and membership of National Health Insurance Scheme were significantly (p < 0.05) associated with the use of healthcare facilities. Younger residents and those without National Health Insurance Scheme membership, formal education, no knowledge of common illnesses and regular income were significantly less likely to use a healthcare facility. For most residents, neither distance (73.2%) nor transportation to health facilities was a problem (74.1%). Conclusion: Conditions of profound environmental hazards, overcrowding, poor-quality housing and lack of health care in Sodom and Gomorrah pose grave threats to the health of the inhabitants. Multisectoral interventions and resource mobilisation championed by the Ministry of Local Government and Rural Development are needed to alter the trend.","disorderly, disorganised, filthy,dirty,impoverished,marginalised, congested settlements,infrastructural scarcity",Negative,Yes,-,No,Diagnostic,Conceptualization of slums,planning,"Slum upgrading,livelihood improvement",-,,http://dx.doi.org/10.4102/phcfm.v8i1.822

Methods: A state-of-the-art review characterized relevant publications from bibliographic databases and grey literature repositories through systematic searching, concept-mapping, relevance and quality filter optimization, methods and outcomes categorization and key article analysis. Results: From an initial population of 749 domain articles published before February 2015, 32 passed context and methods filters to merit full-text analysis. Relevant literature was classified by type (e.g., secondary, primary), design (e.g., case series, intervention), focus (e.g., processes, outcomes) and context (e.g., location, organization). A conceptual framework of EMR implementation determinants (systems, people, processes, products) was developed to represent current knowledge about the effects of EMRs in resource-constrained settings and to facilitate comparisons with studies in other contexts. Discussion: This review provides an overall impression of the types and content of health informatics articles about EMR implementations in sub-Saharan Africa. Little is known about the unique effects of EMR efforts in slum settings. The available reports emphasize the complexity and impact of social considerations, outweighing product and system limitations. Summative guides and implementation toolkits were not found but could help EMR implementers. Conclusion: The future of EMR implementation in sub-Saharan Africa is promising. This review reveals various examples and gaps in understanding how EMR implementations unfold in resource-constrained settings; and opportunities for new inquiry about how to improve deployments in those contexts.","disorderly, disorganised, filthy,dirty,impoverished,marginalised, congested settlements,infrastructural scarcity",Negative,Yes,-,No,Diagnostic,Conceptualization of slums,"policy gaps, planning,public health","Improvement of life,livelihood improvement",-,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12911-016-0354-8

Such interpretations, however, contain uncertainties which may negatively impact the accuracy of classification. In this paper, we study the spatial uncertainties related to the delineations of slums as observed from very high resolution (VHR) images in the contexts of Ahmedabad (India), Nairobi (Kenya) and Cape Town (South Africa). Nineteen image interpretations and supplementary data were acquired for each context by means of semi-structured questionnaires. Slum areas agreed upon by different experts were determined. Uncertainty was modelled using random sets, and boundary variation was quantified using the bootstrapping method. Results show a highly significant difference between slum identification and delineation for the three contexts, whereas the level of experience in slum-related studies of experts is not significant. Factors of the built environment used by experts to distinguish slums from non-slum areas or leading to deviations in slum identification are discussed. We conclude that uncertainties in slum delineations from VHR images can be quantified successfully using modern spatial statistical methods.","disorderly, disorganised, filthy,dirty,impoverished,marginalised, congested settlements,infrastructural scarcity",Negative,Yes,-,No,Diagnostic,Conceptualization of slums,"policy gaps, planning,public health",-,-,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.compenvurbsys.2016.07.010

With around 240,000 inhabitants Kibera plays an important role in Nairobiâs booming economy. Kiberaâs notoriety stems from its lack of a basic functional infrastructure and its contested legal status as residents are excluded from formal access to land, housing and basic urban services. After decades of underperforming policies and failed upgrading projects, new legislation, policies and financing instruments have been established which are set to improve overall living conditions. Major slum improvement lessons learnt from previous slum upgrading policies in Kenya emphasise the importance of community collaboration, communication strategies, capacity building, and welfare policies.","disorderly, disorganised, filthy,dirty,impoverished,marginalised, congested settlements,infrastructural scarcity",Negative,Yes,-,No,Diagnostic,Conceptualization of slums,"policy gaps, planning,public health","Slum upgrading,livelihood improvement",-,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-31794-6_11

These diseases are concentrated in rural areas, conflict zones and urban slums in Africa and other tropical areas. While the World Health Organization recognizes seventeen priority NTDs, the list of conditions present in Africa and elsewhere that are eligible to be classified as NTDs is much longer. Although NTDs are generally marginalized, their associated neurological burden has been almost completely disregarded. However, reports indicate that trichuriasis, schistosomiasis and hookworm infection, among others, cause impairments in memory and cognition, negatively affecting school attendance rates and educational performance particularly among children, as well as agricultural productivity among adults. Consequently, the neurological impairments have substantial influence on education and economic productivity, thus aggravating and perpetuating poverty in affected societies. However, inadequate research, policy and public health attention has been paid to the neurological burdens associated with NTDs. In order to appropriately address these burdens, we recommend the development of policy interventions that focus on the following areas: (i) the introduction of training programs to develop the capacity of scientists and clinicians in research, Diagnostic and treatment approaches (ii) the establishment of competitive research grant schemes to fund cutting-edge research into these neurological impairments, and (iii) the development of public health interventions to improve community awareness of the NTD-associated neurological problems, possibly enhancing disease prevention and expediting treatment.","disorderly, disorganised, filthy,dirty,impoverished,marginalised, congested settlements,infrastructural scarcity",Negative,Yes,-,No,Diagnostic,Conceptualization of slums,planning,Slum upgrading,-,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ensci.2015.11.002

This paper explores how young men and women understand the factors that lead to transactional sex among their peers, and how deprivation of material resources (housing, food and health care access) and consumerism (a desire for fashionable goods) may instigate transactional sex in the urban slums of Blantyre, Malawi. Data from 5 focus group discussions and 12 in-depth interviews undertaken with a total of 60 young men and women aged 18â23 years old, conducted between December 2012 and May 2013, were analysed using anticipated and grounded codes. Housing and food deprivation influenced decisions to engage in transactional sex for both young men and women. Poor health care access and a desire for fashionable goods (such as the latest hair or clothing styles and cellular phones) influenced the decisions of young women that led to transactional sex. Interventions that engage with deprivations and consumerism are essential to reducing sexual and reproductive health risks in urban slums.","disorderly, disorganised, filthy,dirty,impoverished,marginalised, congested settlements,infrastructural scarcity",Negative,Yes,-,No,Diagnostic,Conceptualization of slums,"planning, policy gaps",-,-,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/17441692.2015.1014393

Accordingly, globally accepted anthropometric markers may perform differently in African populations. In the era of rapid emergence of cardio-vascular diseases in sub-Saharan Africa, evidence about the performance of these markers in African settings is essential. The aim of this study was to investigate the inter-relationships among the four main anthropometric indices in measuring overweight and obesity in an urban poor African setting. Methods: Data from a cardiovascular disease risk factor assessment study in urban slums of Nairobi were analyzed. In the major study, data were collected from 5190 study participants. We considered four anthropometric markers of overweight and obesity: Body Mass Index, Waist Circumference, Waist to Hip Ratio, and Waist to Height Ratio. Pairwise correlations and kappa statistics were used to assess the relationship and agreement among these markers, respectively. Discordances between the indices were also analyzed. Results: The weighted prevalence of above normal body composition was 21.6 % by body mass index, 28.9 % by waist circumference, 45.5 % by waist to hip ratio, and 38.9 % by waist to height ratio. The overall inter-index correlation was +0.44. Waist to hip ratio generally had lower correlation with the other anthropometric indices. High level of discordance exists between body mass index and waist to hip ratio. Combining the four indices shows that 791 (16.1 %) respondents had above normal body composition in all four indices. Waist circumference better predicted hypertension and hyperglycemia while waist to height ratio better predicted hypercholesterolemia. Conclusions: There exists a moderate level of correlation and a remarkable level of discordance among the four anthropometric indices with regard to the ascertainment of abnormal body composition in an urban slum setting in Africa. Waist circumference is a better predictor of cardio-metabolic risk.","disorderly, disorganised, filthy,dirty,impoverished,marginalised, congested settlements,infrastructural scarcity",Negative,Yes,-,No,Diagnostic,Conceptualization of slums,planning,-,-,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s40608-016-0126-0

In Africa, where urban growth is almost synonymous with slum growth, entrenched inequality and impoverishment produces multidimensional risk accumulation and threatens the continent's ability not only to implement new commitments, but also to sustain the achievements made to date. This paper, developed from a practitioner viewpoint, argues that an under-utilized and under-resourced strategy for urban risk-reduction and resilience-building is community-driven slum upgrading. It suggests that African cities pursuing a resilient development agenda can significantly increase their implementation capacity through partnership with organized communities.","disorderly, disorganised, filthy,dirty,impoverished,marginalised, congested settlements,infrastructural scarcity",Negative,Yes,-,No,Diagnostic,Conceptualization of slums,"policy gaps, planning,public health",-,-,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijdrr.2017.09.028

However, little is known about whether there is deterioration of the microbiological quality of the intermittent piped water supply at a household level and whether it is a factor in reducing or increasing the occurrence of acute diarrhea among under-five children in slums of Addis Ababa. This study aimed to determine the association of intermittent piped water supplies and point-of-use (POU) contamination of household stored water by Escherichia coli (E. coli) with acute diarrhea among under-five children in slums of Addis Ababa. Methods A community-based matched case-control study was conducted from November to December, 2014. Cases were defined as under-five children with acute diarrhea during the two weeks before the survey. Controls were matched by age and neighborhood with cases by individual matching. Data were collected using a pre-tested structured questionnaire and E. coli analysis of water from piped water supplies and household stored water. A five-tube method of Most Probable Number (MPN)/100 ml standard procedure was used for E. coli analysis. Multivariable conditional logistic regression with 95% confidence interval (CI) was used for data analysis by controlling potential confounding effects of selected socio-demographic characteristics. Main findings During the two weeks before the survey, 87.9% of case households and 51.0% of control households had an intermittent piped water supply for an average of 4.3 days and 3.9 days, respectively. POU contamination of household stored water by E. coli was found in 83.3% of the case households, and 52.1% of the control households. In a fully adjusted model, a periodically intermittent piped water supply (adjusted matched odds ratio (adjusted mOR) = 4.8; 95% CI: 1.3â17.8), POU water contamination in household stored water by E. coli (adjusted mOR = 3.3; 95% CI: 1.1â10.1), water retrieved from water storage containers using handle-less vessels (adjusted mOR = 16.3; 95% CI: 4.4â60.1), and water retrieved by interchangeably using vessels both with and without handle (adjusted mOR = 5.4; 95% CI: 1.1â29.1) were independently associated with acute diarrhea. Conclusion We conclude that provision of continuously available piped water supplies and education of caregivers about proper water retrieval methods of household stored water can effectively reduce POU contamination of water at the household level and thereby reduce acute diarrhea among under-five children in slums of Addis Ababa. Promotion of household water treatment is also highly encouraged until the Cityâs water authority is able to deliver continuously available piped water supplies.","disorderly, disorganised, filthy,dirty,impoverished,marginalised, congested settlements,infrastructural scarcity",Negative,Yes,-,No,Diagnostic,Conceptualization of slums,planning,"Slum upgrading,livelihood improvement",-,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0181516

Yet, some have questioned whether similar barriers exist in sub-Saharan Africa, where women primarily work in the informal sector and may receive extensive kin support. To test whether child care obligations limit African women from engaging in paid work, we conducted a randomized study which provided subsidized early child care (ECC) to selected mothers living in a slum area of Nairobi, Kenya. We found that mothers are eager to send their children to ECC centers and that women who were offered vouchers for subsidized ECC were, on average, 8.5 percentage points (or over 17%) more likely to be employed than those who were not given vouchers. This effect rose to over 20 percentage points among women who actually used the ECC services. Furthermore, working mothers who were given subsidized ECC worked fewer hours than those not given vouchers without any loss to their earnings. These findings provide strong evidence that subsidizing child care for women in poor urban settings could be a powerful mechanism to improve female labor outcomes and reduce gender inequalities in Africa.","disorderly, disorganised, filthy,dirty,impoverished,marginalised, congested settlements,infrastructural scarcity",Negative,Yes,-,No,Diagnostic,Conceptualization of slums,planning,-,-,,

Health challenges of older slum dwellers in Nairobi and the applicability of the age-friendly city approach,"Aboderin I,Kano M,Vincent HA",Slums,2017,African,African,Abstract,"A majority of urban residents in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) and other developing regionslive in informal settlements or slums. Much of the discourse on slum health centres on younger generations, while an intensifying agenda on healthy ageing as yet lacks a systematic focus on slums. Similarly, the global age-friendly cities (AFC) movement does not, thus far, extnd to slums. This paper examines the particular challenges that a slum-focused age-friendly initiative in SSA may need to address, and the relevance of present AFC indicators and domains for initiatives to advance the health and well-being of older slum dwellers. The analysis builds on the case of two slum communities in Nairobi, Kenya. It analyzes two bodies of relevant evidence from these settlements, namely on the health and social circumstances of older residents, and on the local application and measurement of AFC indicators. The findings point to a set of unsurprising, but also less obvious, core health and social adversities that an age-friendly initiative in such settlements would need to consider. The findings show, further, that the current AFC domains and indicators framework only partly capture these adversities, but that there is potential for adapting the framework to be meaningful for slum settings. The paper concludes by underscoring the need for, and opportunities inherent in, the pursuit of an âage-friendly slumsâ initiative going forward.","disorderly, disorganised, filthy,dirty,impoverished,marginalised, congested settlements,infrastructural scarcity",Negative,Yes,-,No,Diagnostic,Conceptualization of slums,"planning, policy gaps, land tenure","inclusivity, improvement of life, slum upgrading",-,,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ijerph14101259

The objectives of this study are to examine the prevalence, potential predictors, and sequelae of MSK among older adults residing in two low resource informal urban settlements or âslumsâ in Nairobi Kenya. Methods Data on older adults aged 60 years and over from two unrelated cross-sectional surveys on the older slum populations are used: a 2006/7 survey on the social, health, and overall well-being of older people (sample N = 831), and a 2016 survey on realities and impacts of long-term care and social protection for older adults (sample n = 1026). Uni and multivariate regressions on the 2006/7 data are employed to examine relationships of back pain and symptoms of arthritis with sex, age, wealth, unemployment, diagnoses of hypertension, and diabetes; and with indicators of subjective well-being and functional ability. Descriptive frequencies and chi-squared tests of association are used on 2016 data to identify the overall prevalence and locations of activity limiting MSK pain, and sex differences in these. Results Prevalence of past month back pain and past 2 week symptoms of arthritis was 44% and 42.6%, respectively. Respective prevalence of past month activity limiting back pain and joint pain was 13.9% and 22.7%. A total of 42.6% of slum residents with a current health problem report MSK as the most severe problem. In multivariate regressions, female sex, unemployment, and diagnosis of hypertension are predictive of back pain and symptoms of arthritis. Both conditions are associated with raised odds of having lower quality of life, poorer life satisfaction, and depressive symptoms, and with mobility impairments and self-care difficulties. Conclusions MSK conditions are salient, and a likely key cause of impaired subjective well-being and functioning among older slum populations in SSA. Further research on determinants and consequences of such conditions in older slum populations is required to inform debate on responses to MSK as part of efforts to reorient SSA health systems to aging and to improve slum health.","disorderly, disorganised, filthy,dirty,impoverished,marginalised, congested settlements,infrastructural scarcity",Negative,Yes,-,No,Diagnostic,Conceptualization of slums,"policy gaps, planning,public health","Improvement of life,livelihood improvement",-,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.berh.2017.11.001

A possible relationship between slum residence and childrenâs health and wellbeing in sub-Saharan Africa has been relatively under-researched. Objective. To investigate the relationship between the type of area of residence and childrenâs and adolescentsâ health and wellbeing in urban Mozambique. Methods. Descriptive and logistic regression techniques were employed on data from 1913 children and 798 adolescents, to analyse several key outcomes. Results. The descriptive findings indicate that children in slum areas are the most disadvantaged, followed by those in quasi-slum areas, in terms of school enrolment, health and the type of care received in the home. Similar descriptive results were found for the adolescentsâ outcomes. Multivariate analyses showed that compared with children in slum areas, those in non-slum areas were more likely to be attending school (odds ratio (OR) 4.22; confidence interval (CI) 1.73 - 10.31), less likely to be typically sick (OR 0.26; CI 0.14 - 0.47) and less likely to be left alone in the household (OR 0.29; CI 0.18 - 0.48). Adolescents in non-slum areas tended to have completed â¥6 years of education (OR 3.01; CI 1.78 - 5.07), to be aware of HIV/AIDS programmes (OR 4.29; CI 2.43 - 7.55), to believe that HIV/AIDS may be transmitted through unprotected sex (OR 13.01; CI 3.76 - 45.02) and to have parents or caregivers who had ever talked to them about matters related to sex (OR 3.15; CI 1.76 - 5.65). Family structure and sowcioeconomic characteristics, together, account for most of the differences between slum and quasi-slum areas, particularly for childrenâs outcomes. Conclusion. The health and the wellbeing of children and adolescents in slums is negatively affected, compared with other urban places in Mozambique. However, for children, family structure and other socioeconomic factors remove most slum/quasi-slum effects.","disorderly, disorganised, filthy,dirty,impoverished,marginalised, congested settlements,infrastructural scarcity",Negative,Yes,-,No,Diagnostic,Conceptualization of slums,planning,-,-,,http://dx.doi.org/10.7196/SAJCH.2018.v12i4.1485

Almost 90% of this increase will take place in Asian and Africa and disproportionately in urban slums. In this context, concerns about the amplification of several neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) are warranted and efforts towards achieving effective mass drug administration (MDA) coverage become even more important. This narrative review considers the published literature on MDA implementation for specific NTDs and in-country experiences under the ENVISION and END in Africa projects to surface features of urban settings that challenge delivery strategies known to work in rural areas. Discussed under the thematics of governance, population heterogeneity, mobility and community trust in MDA, these features include weak public health infrastructure and programs, challenges related to engaging diverse and dynamic populations and the limited accessibility of certain urban settings such as slums. Although the core components of MDA programs for NTDs in urban settings are similar to those in rural areas, their delivery may need adjustment. Effective coverage of MDA in diverse urban populations can be supported by tailored approaches informed by mapping studies, research that identifies context-specific methods to increase MDA coverage and rigorous monitoring and evaluation.","disorderly, disorganised, filthy,dirty,impoverished,marginalised, congested settlements,infrastructural scarcity",Negative,Yes,-,No,Diagnostic,Conceptualization of slums,"policy gaps, planning,public health",-,-,,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/tropicalmed3040122

Furthermore, there is no recent study identifying neither the slums nor their temporal growth/development pattern in Lagos that can backstop any slum management initiative. This study aims to contribute by applying object-based image analysis and intensity analysis to map and link patterns and processes of slum growth in Lagos. RapidEye imagery from 2009 and 2015 were used to create maps for each time point for six land use categories (water, vegetated area, open space, road, slum, and other urban). Intensity analysis was applied to quantify the annual intensity of changes at the category and transition level. An overall accuracy (and kappa coefficient) of 94% (0.9) and 89% (0.86) were achieved for the 2009 and 2015 land use and land cover maps, respectively. This study showed that slums in Lagos have increased spatially during the time interval studied, with a total net gain of 9.18 square kilometers, influenced by the increase in population, mainly due to in-migration to Lagos. However, this study also revealed that slums were actively losing and gaining land area between 2009 and 2015, with an annual gain and loss intensity of 10.08 and 6.41, respectively, compared to the uniform intensity of 3.15. The gain was due to poor maintenance of buildings and encroachment onto available spaces (water and open space), while the loss was attributed to gentrification and demolition processes. A systematic process of transition was observed between slums and other urban (and open space) areas in the interval studied, and this process was mainly influenced by the Lagos state government. This analysis is crucial for designing policy interventions to manage slum growth in Lagos.","disorderly, disorganised, filthy,dirty,impoverished,marginalised, congested settlements,infrastructural scarcity",Negative,Yes,-,No,Diagnostic,Conceptualization of slums,planning,"Slum upgrading,livelihood improvement",-,,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs10071044

Achieving sustainable development from rapid urbanization relies critically on creating cities without slums. We show that it is possible to diagnose systematically the central physical problem of slumsâthe lack of spatial accesses and related servicesâusing a topological analysis of neighborhood maps and resolved by finding solutions to a sequence of constrained optimization problems. We set up the problem by showing that the built environment of any city can be decomposed into two types of networked spacesâaccesses and placesâand prove that these spaces display universal topological characteristics. We then show that while the neighborhoods of developed cities express the same common topology, urban slums fall into a different topological class. We demonstrate that it is always possible to find solutions that grow a street network in existing slums, providing universal accesses at minimal disruption and cost. We then show how elaborations of this procedure that include local preferences and reduce travel distances between places result from additional access construction. These methods are presently taking effect in neighborhoods in Cape Town (South Africa) and Mumbai (India), demonstrating their practical feasibility and emphasizing their role as a platform to enable communities and local governments to combine technical knowledge with local aspirations into contextually appropriate urban sustainable development solutions.","disorderly, disorganised, filthy,dirty,impoverished,marginalised, congested settlements,infrastructural scarcity",Negative,Yes,-,No,Diagnostic,Conceptualization of slums,planning,"Slum upgrading,livelihood improvement",-,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1126/sciadv.aar4644

Out of these more than four billion people, almost one quarter live in slums or informal settlements. In order to improve living conditions and provide possible solutions for the major problems in slums (e.g., insufficient infrastructure), it is important to understand the current situation of this form of settlement and its development. There are many different models that attempt to simulate the development of slums. In this paper, we present data mining models that correlate information about the temporal development of slums with other economic, ecologic, and demographic factors in order to identify dependencies. Different learning algorithms, such as decision rules and decision trees, are used to learn descriptive models for slum development from data, and the results are evaluated with commonly used attribute evaluation methods known from data mining. The results confirm various previously made statements about slum development in a quantitative way, such as the fact that slum development is very strongly linked to the demographic development of a country. Applying the introduced classification models to the most recent data for different regions, it can be shown that the slum development in Africa is expected to be above average.","disorderly, disorganised, filthy,dirty,impoverished,marginalised, congested settlements,infrastructural scarcity",Negative,Yes,-,No,Diagnostic,Conceptualization of slums,"policy gaps, planning,public health","slum upgrading, livelihood improvement",-,,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/urbansci2030081

794,II,SIAMA PHILBERT,Journal,Analysing child linear growth trajectories among under-5 children in two Nairobi informal settlements,"Faye CM,Fonn S,Levin J,Kimani-Murage E",Slums,2019,European,European,Abstract,"Objective We sought to identify factors associated with linear growth among under-5 children in two urban informal settlements in Nairobi.Design We used longitudinal data for the period 2007-2012 from under-5 children recruited in the two sites between birth and 23 months and followed up until they reached 5 years of age. We fitted a generalized linear model on height-for-age Z-scores using the generalized estimating equations method to model linear growth trajectories among under-5 children. Known for its flexibility, the model provides strong parameter estimates and accounts for correlated observations on the same child.Setting Two urban informal settlements in Nairobi, Kenya.Participants Under-5 children (n 1917) and their mothers (n 1679).Results The findings show that child weight at birth, exclusive breast-feeding and immunization status were key determinants of linear growth among under-5 children. Additionally, maternal characteristics (mother's age, marital status) and household-level factors (socio-economic status, size of household) were significantly associated with child linear growth. There were biological differences in linear growth, as female children were more likely to grow faster than males. Finally, the model captured significant household-level effects to investigate further.Conclusions Findings from the study point to the need to improve the targeting of child health programmes directed at the urban poor population in Nairobi. Specific modifiable determinants of child linear growth, particularly child weight at birth, exclusive breast-feeding, immunization status and mother's background characteristics, should be considered when designing interventions aiming at addressing child health inequities in these settings.","impoverished,mmalnutritioned, infrastructural scarcity",Negative,Yes,-,No,Diagnostic,Conceptualization of slums,planning,Slum upgrading,-,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1368980019000491
795,II,SIAMA PHILBERT,Journal,Childbearing desires and behaviour: A prospective assessment in Nairobi slums,"Machiyama K,Mumah JN,Mutua M,Cleland J",Slums,2019,African,African,Abstract,"Background: Advancing an understanding of childbearing desires is an important precursor to achievement of the policy goal of reducing unintended pregnancies. It has been long debated that concepts of fertility desires and planning may be particularly problematic in sub-Saharan Africa. However, examination of the utility of fertility preference measures and their link to reproductive behaviour is still rare in the region. The aim of this study is to assess the predictive validity of future childbearing desires on subsequent reproduction among women living in the highly unpredictable circumstances of Nairobi slums. Methods: We used data from a longitudinal study (2007-2010) nested in the Nairobi Urban Health Demographic Surveillance System that is located in two slums in Nairobi, Kenya. We analysed baseline fertility desires among 4577 postpartum women. Cox proportional hazard model was employed to examine the effect of fertility desires on subsequent reproduction. Results: One-third of the women wanted no more children and 37% wanted to wait for at least five years at baseline. While two-thirds of the women who wanted to have a child soon became pregnant within three years, less than one-third of those wanting no more children became pregnant. The multivariable analysis shows that the probability of becoming pregnant among women who expressed desires to stop or delay childbearing at least for five years was 50% less than among women who wanted to have a child in two to four years. In addition to prospective fertility desires, level of woman's education, residence and ethnicity exerted important influences on implementation of baseline preferences. Conclusions: Our study finds a strong link between baseline fertility desires and subsequent reproduction. A large difference in pregnancy risk was observed between those who wanted no more children and those who wanted another child. The link between a woman's stated desire to stop childbearing and subsequent childbearing is just as strong in the Nairobi slums as elsewhere. In addition, the findings revealed a pronounced gradient in pregnancy risk according to preferred spacing length, which support other evidence on the important contribution of long-term spacing or postponement to fertility decline in sub-Saharan Africa.","disorderly, disorganised, filthy,dirty,impoverished,marginalised, congested settlements,infrastructural scarcity",Negative,Yes,-,No,Diagnostic,Conceptualization of slums,"policy gaps, planning,public health","Improvement of life,livelihood improvement",-,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12884-019-2245-3

Most of these additional urban residents will be concentrated in slums. However, government documentation of slums is incomplete and unreliable, and many slums remain undocumented. It is necessary to employ creative methods to locate and sample these understudied populations. We used satellite image analysis and fieldwork to build a sample of Indian slums. We show that living conditions vary along a wide-ranging continuum of wellbeing; different points correspond to different policy needs. We also show that most variation in conditions is due to differences across rather than within neighbourhoods. These findings have important implications for urban policy. First, satellite data can be a useful tool to locate undocumented settlements. Second, policy must be appropriately nuanced to respond to wide-ranging needs. Finally, variation patterns suggest that policies should be targeted at the neighbourhood rather than the individual level.","disorderly, disorganised, filthy,dirty,impoverished,marginalised, congested settlements,infrastructural scarcity",Negative,Yes,-,No,Diagnostic,Conceptualization of slums,"policy gaps, planning,public health",-,-,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0956247818798744

Results: A total of 130 homeless and slum dwellers took part in the study out of which 7 (5.4%) participants were diagnosed with diabetes while 13 (10%) were considered as having prediabetes. This is slightly lower than what had been reported two decades ago but similar to overall estimates of diabetes prevalence in Africa (5.7%). Diagnosis of normoglycemia, prediabetes and diabetes was based on individual's hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) level: â¤ 5.9%, 6.4-6.0%, and â¥ 6.5%, respectively. There was no significant association between prevalence of diabetes or prediabetes and the socio-demographic characteristics of the participants. The slightly lower diabetes prevalence among the homeless and slum dwellers compared to the general population may be due to constant movement of these people in the streets, a practice that could serve as a form of exercise for them. Intensive social support aimed at preventing and managing diabetes is crucial if we are to further reduce the incidence of diabetes in homeless people.","disorderly, disorganised, filthy,dirty,impoverished,marginalised, congested settlements,infrastructural scarcity",Negative,Yes,-,No,Diagnostic,Conceptualization of slums,planning,"Improvement of life,livelihood improvement",-,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s13104-019-4613-5

Design/methodology/approach: The research method relied on literature review and fieldwork. It included surveys, activities with the communities, interviews and questionnaires. The data collected were subject to cross-disciplinary and comparative analysis. Findings: The paper analyses the innovative methods and solutions used by NGOs in informal settlement upgrading and housing improvement works related to disaster risk reduction, namely, community mapping and design, and show how they end up building community resilience. Research limitations/implications: Grasping the impacts of NGOsâ work whether in slums of Brazil or Africa requires staying with communities for a significant amount of time. However, those stays raise many practical problems regarding security, health and related costs. Originality/value: The existing literature misses to address from a comparative perspective, the methods used by social workers and designers teams in slums. This paper aims at filling this gap in slum studies. Its originality and value rely on the particular experience of the authors, who were personally involved in the NGOs actions and could deepen the connections between vulnerabilities, risk and successful aid-self-help practices.","disorderly, disorganised, filthy,dirty,impoverished,marginalised, congested settlements,infrastructural scarcity",Negative,Yes,-,No,Diagnostic,Conceptualization of slums,planning,Slum upgrading,-,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1108/IJDRBE-09-2019-0063

Little is known about their nutritional situation, as slums are often underrepresented in standard surveys. This study analyzes issues of food security and dietary quality in East African slums using household-level and individual-level data collected in Nairobi and Kampala. The household food insecurity access scale (HFIAS) is used as a subjective measure of food security. Moreover, calorie availability and different dietary diversity scores are calculated based on 7-day food consumption recalls at the household level and 24-h dietary recalls at the individual level. The large majority of the slum households are food insecure and suffer from low dietary quality. Rates of undernourishment are considerably higher than what country-level statistics report, suggesting that slum dwellers deserve more explicit attention in initiatives to improve nutrition. Household-level indicators are significantly correlated with individual-level indicators for women and children. This means that household-level data, which are easier to collect, can proxy for individual nutrition up to a certain extent when individual-level data are unavailable. Regression models show that household income is one of the main factors explaining dietary patterns. Hence, facilitating access to lucrative employment is an important entry point for improving nutrition in slums.","disorderly, disorganised, filthy,dirty,impoverished,marginalised, congested settlements,infrastructural scarcity",Negative,Yes,-,No,Diagnostic,Conceptualization of slums,"policy gaps, planning,public health","Slum upgrading,livelihood improvement",-,,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su11215999

In South Africa, high levels of inequality, poverty, and unemployment contribute to widespread migration. The influx of migrant workers to cities, however, is rarely matched with adequate housing and infrastructure, resulting in the formation and growth of urban informal settlements. Despite the persistence of the slum phenomenon, very few studies provide an in-depth understanding of the metabolic processes that link these spaces, and informal economies, to the broader urban environment and economy. This article therefore utilized a multiscale integrated assessment of the societal and ecosystem metabolism approach to examine human activity and land use in Enkanini, an urban informal settlement in Stellenbosch, South Africa. The results highlight a number of issues to be addressed through spatial, developmental, and local economic policy, such as the need for improved transport linkages. The time-use results show that Enkanini is a net provider of labor to the surrounding area. Further, geographical mapping indicates Enkanini as a small, but vibrant, informal economy, while being grossly underserviced in terms of water, waste, and sanitation infrastructure. Key implications are discussed in terms of the theoretical, methodological, societal, and policy impact of the study, including the need for city observatories that conduct regular data collection and analysis.","disorderly, disorganised, filthy,dirty,impoverished,marginalised, congested settlements,infrastructural scarcity",Negative,Yes,-,No,Diagnostic,Conceptualization of slums,"policy gaps, planning,public health","livelihood improvement, slum upgrading",-,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jiec.12776

To address the living conditions, many African countries have been making attempts to provide housing for poor households in informal settlements notably through relocation to newly developed housing. In this paper, housing developed for people who formerly lived in informal settlements within Addis Ababa and Johannesburg is considered in terms of their social and environmental dimensions. The two contexts highlight not only the crucial shortcomings of the 'slum' clearance and new housing development approach in terms of social capital, but also demonstrate that it comes with opportunities for environmental sustainability. The key takeaway is that improvements in informal settlements must be simultaneously directed at quality of life (in its entirety) and environmental quality.","disorderly, disorganised, filthy,dirty,impoverished,marginalised, congested settlements,infrastructural scarcity",Negative,Yes,-,No,Diagnostic,Conceptualization of slums,"policy gaps, planning,public health","Slum upgrading,livelihood improvement",-,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1680/jurdp.19.00006

These slums mainly can be found in cities of the global south and are characterized by poor living conditions and usually insufficient access to basic infrastructure such as water or energy. In order to improve the living conditions of slum inhabitants, information about the number, location and size of the slums is required to plan supply infrastructure. We therefore identify morphological slums in eight different cities in Africa, South African and Asian, using remote sensing data and analyse their size distributions. We show that 84.6% of all observed morphological slums have a size between 0.001 and 0.1 km2. These results rely on a consistent approach using a clear ontology and conceptual frame for classification. However, classification methods for these underserved areas differ. We show slum classifications based on different methods reveal a strong dependency between the particular method and the resulting size distribution. The study shows the relevance of remote sensing for the investigation of slums and the results can be used for infrastructure planning, as infrastructure improvement projects are often limited to the large known slums.

This paper presents a discursive analysis of touristsâ online reviews of two township tours in Cape Town, South Africa. We investigate how, and to what ends, tourists collectively construct townships as places of hope on TripAdvisor; we question how these reviews feed into broader narratives of urban poverty in the global south. We show how tourists draw on both neoliberal and colonial discourses to construct townships as places of hopeâvibrant cultural spaces, rich in non-material assets, inhabited by happy, hard-working residents. We show that by producing slums as productive cultural spaces, tourists are able to resist the stigma associated with slum tourism and position themselves as ethical, enlightened and morally superior tourists. We argue that neoliberal and colonial discourses operate together to produce sanitised representations of townships that both obscure inequalities between poor residents and wealthy tourists from the global north and depoliticise issues like poor infrastructure in townships. In discussing the broader implications of the study, we highlight the importance of producing nuanced representations of townships that acknowledge residentsâ assets and excellence, while also foregrounding how they live within the oppressive constraints inherent in enduring systems of inequality.","disorderly, disorganised, filthy,dirty,impoverished,marginalised, congested settlements,infrastructural scarcity",Negative,Yes,-,No,Diagnostic,Conceptualization of slums,"policy gaps, planning,public health",Slum upgrading,-,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.geoforum.2020.01.006

However, the interventions impacts remain less understood. We assessed the impact of the Urban Program on Livelihoods and Income Fortification and Socio-civic Transformation (UPLIFT) project on QoL, psychological wellbeing, self-esteem, and the quality of neighbourhood social environment of young people aged 13â25 years in slum areas of Makindye and Nakawa Divisions in Kampala, Uganda. Methods: The study was designed as a mixed method evaluation using repeated cross-sectional survey and grounded theory in both the intervention and comparison communities. The intervention effect was estimated using the difference-in-differences Kernel propensity-score matching technique, with bootstrapping. The ârcsâ option was used given that data were from repeated cross-sectional surveys. A thematic analysis was adopted for the qualitative data to triangulate and complement the quantitative data. Results: The UPLIFT project led to an improvement in QoL, psychological wellbeing, and self-esteem of young people. In terms of QoL, the project led to a six-percentage point increase in quality of living conditions scores (where higher scores reflect better living conditions; lower ones, worse living conditions). However, a negative effect was observed for personal independence whilst the project did not have any impact on social relations. In terms of self-esteem and psychological wellbeing, the project led to a 4.6-point increase in self-esteem scores, a 5.4-point increase in self-acceptance scores, a 5.3- point increase in purpose in life scores, a 5.7 - point increase in personal growth, and a 10.7-point increase in autonomy scores. However, the project had a negative effect on personal independence; and had no impact on environmental mastery and the quality of neighbourhood social environment. Conclusion: Functional community-owned assets accumulation and capacity building initiatives for young people in slum areas improved their psychological wellbeing and quality of life. However, such initiatives do not appear to address social relationships and personal independence of young people in slum areas.","disorderly, disorganised, filthy,dirty,impoverished,marginalised, congested settlements,infrastructural scarcity",Negative,Yes,-,No,Diagnostic,Conceptualization of slums,"planning, policy gaps, land tenure","livelihood improvement, slum upgrading",-,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12889-020-09868-y

However, there exists limited understanding of the impact of slums on health in the region. To address this knowledge gap, we conducted a systematic search in PubMed, Google, and Google Scholar to identify and review studies examining the slumâhealth relationship in sub-Saharan African cities. Subsequently, we performed thematic analysis of 40 studies to identify themes that explain the health impact of slums in the region. The majority of studies characterize slums as health-damaging settings, where poverty and unfavorable environmental conditions pose threats to public health and safety. Only a handful of studies suggest a beneficial relationship between slums and health, in such areas as affordable housing provision, employment generation, and community cohesion. We argue that the literatureâs overwhelming emphasis on the environmental risks of slums feeds into a neoliberal urban agenda that seeks to clear slums at the expense of their beneficial contributions to health. Accordingly, we advocate a shift in policy discourse, from static characterization of slums as health risks to a health-promotion agenda that emphasizes the housing and service rights of slum populations.","disorderly, disorganised, filthy,dirty,impoverished,marginalised, congested settlements,infrastructural scarcity",Negative,Yes,-,No,Diagnostic,Conceptualization of slums,"planning, policy gaps","Improvement of life,livelihood improvement",-,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/1757975919856273

One setting of particular importance is the informal settlements or 'slums' that are gradually dominating the urban space. We undertook a scoping review and synthesis of existing evidence on adolescent SRHR in slums in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) focusing on the characteristics and nature of existing evidence. Methods: The scoping review was conducted based on Arksey and O'Malley framework and in accordance with the guidance on scoping reviews from the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) and using PRISMA reporting guidelines for scoping reviews. A comprehensive search was undertaken in PubMed, POPLINE, African Journals Online (AJOL), Bioline International and Google Scholar. The search was confined to studies published in peer reviewed journals and reports published online between January 2000 and May 2019. Studies were included in the review if they addressed SRHR issues among adolescents living in urban slums in SSA. Results: The review included a total of 54 studies. The majority (79.5%) of studies were quantitative. The bulk of studies (85.2%) were observational studies with only eight intervention studies. While half (27) of the studies focused exclusively on adolescents (10-19 years), 12 studies combined adolescents with other young people (10-24 years). The studies were skewed towards sexual behavior (44%) and HIV/AIDS (43%) with very few studies focusing on other SRHR issues such as contraception, abortion, gender-based violence and sexually transmitted infections (STIs) other than HIV. Most of the studies highlighted the significantly higher risks for poor SRHR outcomes among adolescents in slums as compared to their peers in other settlements. Conclusion: Young people growing up in slums face tremendous challenges in relation to their SRHR needs resulting in poor outcomes such as early and unintended pregnancy, STIs, and sexual violence. The results of this review point to several potential target areas for programming, policy, and research aimed at improved adolescent SRHR in slums in SSA.","disorderly, disorganised, filthy,dirty,impoverished,marginalised, congested settlements,infrastructural scarcity",Negative,Yes,-,No,Diagnostic,Conceptualization of slums,"policy gaps, planning,public health","livelihood improvement, slum upgrading",-,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12978-020-00998-5

W N,Maina S,Munene M",Slums,2021,African,African,Abstract,"Kibera is the largest slum areas in Nairobi and the largest urban slum in Africa (UN-HABITAT, 2008). It""s characterized by poorly constructed mabati (iron sheet) structures, poor-drainage systems, and lack of clean water, electricity, medical care etc. Most of Kibera slum residents live in extreme poverty, earning less than Ksh. 100 per day. The government of Kenya set up the Kenya Slum Upgrading Program (KENSUP) in 2004 whose main aim was to provide low-cost housing to residents living in the slum areas including Kibera, Mathare, Kayole and Dandora. The Kibera Soweto East Project also dubbed ""The Canaan Estate"" was one of the first projects under the program and comprised of 21 blocks of five floors each sitting in a five-acre piece of land. However in 2017, more than half of the apartments had been given out for renting or sold by the allocated owners and the residents went back to the slum. The major reason for these phenomenon was due economical enrichment. 40% of the residents preferred to rent their houses as means of earning extra income. However, 50% of the residents stated that the houses did not cater for their needs and lifestyles taking into consideration that they now own the houses. The slum houses allows them to manipulate as well as modify their interior spaces, a concept they are not able to implement in their new houses. This is indeed a great challenge due to their rapid growth in population and change in need and lifestyle over time. This study therefore sought to determine how flexible are the interior spaces of the low-cost housing units in Kibera and establish how they accommodate different arrangement of furniture pieces as well as allow performance of different tasks/functions within a particular space. The research design was the case study model where the research employs the collection and analysis of qualitative data obtained through examination of documents, interviews, observation and taking of photographs. The study was carried out at The Kibera Soweto East Housing Project, Kenya and its residents plus the professionals are involved in the project are the respondents. Findings revealed that the government did try to ensure that the low-cost houses are kept simple, regular/standard by installing standard window and door sizes, eliminating storage facilities apart from the kitchen, installing tiles for the floor, walls for the bathroom and counter top for the kitchen and also installing normal light fixtures, kitchen shelves and sanitary ware. This study findings contributes to informing the development of interior plans and layouts that are ideal for low-cost housing units. Affordability can indeed be achieved in low-cost housing but if the interior plans and layouts are not up to standard then it fails to fulfil its purpose of improving the living standards and quality of life of residents living in these housing units.","impoverished,,infrastructural scarcity",Negative,Yes,"UN-HABITAT, Sampling, Interviewing",Yes,Diagnostic,"conceptualization of slums, housing, marginalisation, sanitation","policy gaps, planning, types of houses",Slum upgrading,-,,

In sub-Saharan Africa, adolescents make up the greatest proportion of the population, with 23% of the population aged 10â19. And these numbers are predicted to grow rapidlyâparticularly in urban areas as rural youth migrate to cities for economic opportunities. While adolescents and youth are subject to high sexual and reproductive health risks, few efforts have been documented for addressing these in urban settings, especially in poor settlements. Methods: The Challenge Initiative (TCI) is a demand-driven, family planning platform for sustainable scale and impact that lets city governmentsâin particular urban slumsâlead implementation. It is currently active in 11 countries in Africa and Asian. In June 2018, TCI heightened its focus on adolescent and youth sexual and reproductive health (AYSRH) for youth living in urban slums. It now supports 39 city governments. TCI dedicates technical and program support to married (including first-time parents) and unmarried youth ages 15â24 years. Using an innovative coaching model and an online learning platform (TCI University), TCI supports city governments as they implement AYSRH interventions to accelerate the impact of TCI's model for rapid scale. Results: TCI has been assessing the performance of cities implementing its AYSRH approaches using its RAISE tool and has found considerable improvement over two rounds of assessments through TCI coaching and support for adaptation of its high-impact interventions between the first and second round. Conclusions: TCI's AYSRH approach scaled rapidly to 39 cities and multiple urban slums since 2018, using its evidence-based interventions and coaching model. In the context of universal health coverage, TCI has supported segmented demand generation and improved access to quality and affordable contraceptive as well as youth-friendly health services. It provides a menu of interventions for cities to implement for youthâincluding such approaches as public-private partnerships with pharmacies and quality assurance using quick checklistsâalong with an innovative coaching model. This approach has facilitated greater access to contraceptive methods of choice for youth.","disorderly, disorganised, filthy,dirty,impoverished,marginalised, congested settlements,infrastructural scarcity",Negative,Yes,-,No,Diagnostic,Conceptualization of slums,"policy gaps, planning,public health",-,-,,http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fgwh.2021.673168

However, there is limited evidence on the burden and its associated factors in the sub-Saharan African context. Objective: The aim of this study was to determine the levels and identify determinants of multimorbidity from chronic conditions in two urban slums in Nairobi. Methods: Data collected from 2003 study participants aged 40â60 years in two urban slums of the Nairobi Urban Health and Demographic Surveillance System in 2015 were used. Using self-report, anthropometry and key biomarkers, data on 16 conditions including chronic diseases, behavioral disorders and metabolic abnormalities were gathered. Lifetime multimorbidity defined by the occurrence of at least two chronic conditions in an individual at any time during their life course was computed. Factors associated with lifetime multimorbidity were identified using multiple logistic regression. Findings: A total of 2,081 chronic conditions were identified among 1,302 individuals. While 701 (35.0%) had no chronic condition, single morbidity was reported in 726 (36.2%) of the study population. The overall prevalence of lifetime multimorbidity was 28.7%. The prevalence of dyads and triads of simultaneous occurrences of conditions (episodic multimorbidity) was 20.8% and 6.1%, respectively. Single morbidity was Positively associated with gender and alcohol consumption; and negatively associated with employment. Women, older people, the unemployed, current smokers and current alcohol consumers had higher levels of lifetime multimorbidity in the study population. Interpretation: The findings of this study indicate that a considerable proportion of adults living in urban slums experience multimorbidity from chronic conditions. Further studies with a better rigor to establish temporal associations between socio-demographic factors and the occurrence of chronic conditions are needed to explore the impacts and implications on health status and health system.","disorderly, disorganised, filthy,dirty,impoverished,marginalised, congested settlements,infrastructural scarcity",Negative,Yes,-,No,Diagnostic,Conceptualization of slums,"planning, policy gaps",-,-,,http://dx.doi.org/10.5334/GH.771

The results revealed that only 51.3% of slum dwellers have pipe water connections, while 33.4% rely on public standpipes. Furthermore, 28.4% make use of boreholes, while 46% use rainwater. About 12.5% of the population cover a distance of more than 200 m to fetch water. The pattern of water flow in several neighbourhoods is irregular; this precipitates the spread of waterborne diseases.

However, despite their rapidly growing populations, public health research in sub-Saharan Africa has yet to address the role of residential environments in the health and well-being of older adults. In this study, we utilized an ethnographic research methodology to explore barriers and facilitators to health among older adults residing in two contrasting neighborhoods in Accra, Ghana. Our specific objective was to identify patterns of health risks among older adults in the two neighborhoods. Data were collected through qualitative interviews with a purposive sample of health workers (n = 5), community leaders (n = 2), and older adults residing in a slum and non-slum neighborhood (n = 30). Our thematic data analysis revealed that, despite different underlying drivers, health barriers across the slum and non-slum were largely similar. The harmful effects of these health barriers â poor built environments, housing precariousness, unsanitary living conditions, defective public services, and social incivilities â were mitigated by several facilitators to health, including affordable housing and social supports in the slum and better housing and appealing doors in the non-slum. Our study contributes to a more nuanced understanding of the ways in which aging and urban environments intersect to influence population health in resource poor settings. In particular, rather than the commonly referenced dichotomy of poor and non-poor settlements in discourses of neighborhood health, our findings point to convergence of health vulnerabilities that are broadly linked to urban poverty and governmental neglect of the elderly.","disorderly, disorganised, filthy,dirty,impoverished,marginalised, congested settlements,infrastructural scarcity",Negative,Yes,-,No,Diagnostic,Conceptualization of slums,"policy gaps, planning,public health","livelihood improvement, slum upgrading",-,,http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2021.650861

Multivariable linear regression analyses of the data revealed no statistically significant difference between the slum and non-slum respondents in physical (coeff: 0.5; 95% CI: -1.7, 2.8; p = 0.642) and psychological (coeff: -0.2; 95% CI: -3.0, 2.6; p = 0.893) QoL. However, the slum respondents reported significantly higher social QoL than the non-slum respondents (coeff: -3.2; 95% CI: -5.6, -0.8; p = 0.010), while the reverse was true in environmental QoL (coeff: 4.2; 95% CI: 2.3, 6.2; p < 0.001). The existence of strong social support systems in the slum and better housing and neighbourhood environmental conditions in the non-slum may have accounted for the observed variation in social and environmental QoL. Thus, contrary to popular discourses that vilify slums as health-damaging milieus, these findings offer a more nuanced picture, and suggest that some features of slums may constitute important health resources for older adults.","disorderly, disorganised, filthy,dirty,impoverished,marginalised, congested settlements,infrastructural scarcity",Negative,Yes,-,No,Diagnostic,Conceptualization of slums,"planning, policy gaps, land tenure","Slum upgrading,livelihood improvement",-,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.socscimed.2020.113659

We also find that the countrywide distribution of cases across states/provinces in these nations also displays similar inequality, indicating self-similarity across scales. Neighbourhoods with slums are found to contain the highest density of cases across all cities under consideration, revealing that slums constitute the most at-risk urban locations in this epidemic. We present a stochastic network model to study the spread of a respiratory epidemic through physically proximate and accidental daily human contacts in a city, and simulate outcomes for a city with two kinds of neighbourhoods - slum and non-slum. The model reproduces observed empirical outcomes for a broad set of parameter values - reflecting the potential validity of these findings for epidemic spread in general, especially across cities of the developing world. We also find that distribution of cases becomes less unequal as the epidemic runs its course, and that both peak and cumulative caseloads are worse for slum neighbourhoods than non-slums at the end of an epidemic. Large slums in the developing world, therefore, contain the most vulnerable populations in an outbreak, and the continuing growth of metropolises in Asian and Africa presents significant challenges for future respiratory outbreaks from perspectives of public health and socioeconomic equity.","disorderly, disorganised, filthy,dirty,impoverished,marginalised, congested settlements,infrastructural scarcity",Negative,Yes,-,No,Diagnostic,Conceptualization of slums,planning,"livelihood improvement, slum upgrading",-,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1098/rsif.2020.0599

From Lagos to Dakar, move one or two kilometers away from the city centers and one is faced with filth and squalor that are summed up in two words âurban slums, in which a great majority of city populations reside. In Nigeria, population living in slums as percentage of urban population is put at 50.2 % in 2014, up from 41.0% in 2007. This highlights the rapid growth of urban slums in Africa with rapid urbanization largely fueled by rural-urban migration. Incidentally, lessons from COVID-19 indicate that if the trend in the growth of unplanned slum settlements are not checked, they will become the hotspots for pandemic transmission in Africa, as the slum populations are part and parcel of the entire urban population who indeed are key drivers of city activities in terms of labour supply, as well as their engagements in small scale informal business activities in the cities. In the light of existing knowledge on the potential threat of dense slum settlements to the spread of pandemic, this paper reviews the appropriateness of traditional approach to urban renewal programmes in Africa and makes recommendations for paradigm shift as historical evidences reveal that COVID-19 is neither the first nor the last pandemic.","disorderly, disorganised, filthy,dirty,impoverished,marginalised, congested settlements,infrastructural scarcity",Negative,Yes,-,No,Diagnostic,Conceptualization of slums,"planning, policy gaps",-,-,,http://dx.doi.org/10.52417/ajhse.v2i1.120

To be prepared to meet the needs of older people living in slums, it is necessary to know more about their quality of life (QoL). The objective of this review is to identify instruments, which can be used by researchers to assess the QoL of older adults living in African countries, especially those dwelling in slums. Methods: A scoping review was performed using the databases Scopus, PubMed, and ISI Web of Science to retrieve studies published from January 2008 â September 2020. Studies were included if they reported generic QoL instruments, focused on adults with a mean age â¥ 50 and were conducted in African countries. Results: In total, 18 studies were included using 7 unique instruments to measure QoL (EUROHIS-QOL-8, SWLS, WHOQOL-OLD, the WHOQOL-BREF, SF-36, SF-12 and RAND-38). All instruments could be interviewer-administered and had 5â36 items. However, little is known about their psychometric properties (validity and reliability), time-investment and cultural sensitivity of the domains included in the instruments. Conclusions: Even though this review retrieved instruments used to assess QoL of older adults in African countries, there is a need for further research on adjustment and validation of currently existing QoL instruments. In addition, the development and validation of a new instrument which can be used in (illiterate) older populations, living in slums in Africa should be considered.","disorderly, disorganised, filthy,dirty,impoverished,marginalised, congested settlements,infrastructural scarcity",Negative,Yes,-,No,Diagnostic,Conceptualization of slums,planning,-,-,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12877-021-02262-2

Urban sediments from informal settlements (slums) on the Nairobi, Ngong and Mathare Rivers (n = 25), were evaluated for sediment quality. Microtox bioassay identified 8 sites as toxic, 9 as moderately toxic and 8 as non-toxic. Slum sediments were characterised by high total organic carbon and Rock-Eval pyrolysis revealed bound carbon from a mix of raw sewage and domestic refuse. Sediments from Kiambio, Kibera, Mathare and Kawangware slums contained high coprostanol at 55â298 Î¼g/g and epicoprostanol at 3.2â21.7 Î¼g/g confirming appreciable incorporation of untreated human faeces.

The purpose of our study was to determine the caries experience, risk factors, indicators and their association with anthropometric indices among children in a Nigerian slum. Methods: this was a cross sectional survey that utilised cluster sampling technique for recruiting the study participants. The participants included children from the four cluster areas of Makoko; Makoko North, Makoko Central area, on Water residents and South-East Makoko in Lagos, Nigeria; 684 children were enlisted for the study. Caries was recorded based on the WHO criteria while the weight for age (WAZ), height for age (HAZ), and weight for height (WHZ) measures were used to assess each childÂ´s nutritional state. The chi-square test was used to test bivariate associations. Statistical significance was set at 0.05. Results: out of the 684 children seen, 64 (9.9%) had dmft â¥1 with range of 1-12; (127 primary teeth were decayed; 6 missing due to caries; 0 filled); while 45 (7.1%) had Decayed Missing Filled Teeth (DMFT) â¥1 with range of 1-6; (79 permanent teeth were decayed; 14 missing due to caries; 0 filled). Maternal and Paternal educational level, childÂ´s age, consumption of cariogenic meals, and history of dental visits were all significantly associated with caries experience (p<0.05). For children with dental caries, the mean weight for height, height-for-age, weight for age-and BMI-for-age z-scores were 0.33Â±2.6;-1.49Â±1.8 and-0.79Â±1.90.58,-0.16), respectively, and these z-score values were lower than those in the caries-free children. The BMI-for-age z-scores were significantly lower in children with dental caries than in caries free children (p=0.005). Conclusion: dental caries, which was mainly untreated was moderately prevalent among the children surveyed in the urban slum. There was also a significant association between the presence of caries in this population and low BMI.

For single mothers living in informal settlements kin networks may be highly dispersed and offer little day-to-day childrearing support, but may provide opportunities for child fostering. OBJECTIVE Our study uses a linked lives approach, where single mothersâ connections with kin and romantic partners may influence whether â and what type of â kin are relied on to support child fostering. METHODS We leverage an innovative survey on the kin networks of 404 single mothers and 741 children, collected in 2016, and 41 in-depth interviews conducted in 2011 and 2013, to explore fostering among single mothers in Korogocho and Viwandani, two slums in Nairobi, Kenya. RESULTS Quantitative findings show 6.2% of single mothersâ children are fostered, with provision of emotional support associated with lower likelihood of fostering. Both quantitative and qualitative results reflect strong reliance on maternal kin. Maternal kin play a key role in fostering to protect children, to fulfill traditional lineage obligations, and due to their willingness to foster when others will not. CONTRIBUTION This study contributes to a growing body of research on the role of kin in contemporary fostering arrangements in sub-Saharan Africa. In particular, we highlight fostering among a potentially highly vulnerable group: the children of single mothers in slum settlements. Sending children to live with kin may be an important coping strategy for single mothers, both to reduce the burden of raising children alone and to provide children with opportunities to grow up outside the slums.","disorderly, disorganised, filthy,dirty,impoverished,marginalised, congested settlements,infrastructural scarcity",Negative,Yes,-,No,Diagnostic,Conceptualization of slums,"planning, policy gaps, land tenure",Slum upgrading,-,,http://dx.doi.org/10.4054/DemRes.2022.46.30

Uganda is currently hosting unprecedented big numbers of refugees from the East African region. Recent evidence shows increased spread of multi-drug resistant TB (MDR-TB) across East Africa as a result of migrants from Somalia- a high MDR-TB prevalent country, calling for urgent identification and management of cases for the countries in the region. One of the strategies recommended is optimization of diagnosis, treatment and prevention of TB in refugees. This study aimed at exploring the barriers to and facilitators for TB case finding and retention in care among urban slum refugees and suggestions on how to improve. This was to guide the development of interventions to improve TB case finding and retention in care among the said population. Methods: A cross-sectional study utilizing qualitative methods was conducted among refugees in an urban slum in Kampala City, Uganda. Key informant interviews with health care workers and community leaders and in-depths interviews with refugee TB patients and care takers of TB patients were conducted (30 interviews in total). Interview questions were based on constructs from the COMB-B model (Capability, Opportunity and Motivation Model of Behaviour change). Manual content analysis was performed and identified targeted intervention strategies guided by the related Behavior Change Wheel implementation framework. Results: Key barriers included; physical capability (availability of and easily accessible private facilities in the community with no capacity to diagnose and treat TB), psychological capability (lack of knowledge about TB among refugees), social opportunity (wide spread TB stigma and language barrier), physical opportunity (poor living conditions, mobility of refugees), reflective motivation (lack of facilitation for health workers), automatic motivation (discrimination and rejection of TB patients). Facilitators were; physical capability (availability of free TB services in the public health facilities), social opportunity (availability of translators). We identified education, incentivization, training, enablement, and restructuring of the service environment as relevant intervention functions with potential to address barriers to and enhance facilitators of TB case finding and retention among refugees in urban slums. Conclusion: The key barriers to TB control among refugees living urban slums in Kampala- Uganda, included; poor access to health services, limited knowledge about TB, TB stigma, language barrier and lack of facilitation of community health workers. Identified intervention strategies included; education, training, enablement, environmental restructuring and persuasion.

City dwellers access food from retail outlets in a country where dispatching food is a lucrative business. Hence, food price increases pose challenges to urban households. The public broadcaster (i.e., South African Broadcasting Corporation, other private television stations (eTV, eNCA, and radio stations broadcast food marketing information through eleven official languages. Digital food marketing through cellular phone networks is also on the rise. ICT is a potential tool in the fight against food insecurity and hunger, since its use and range of application continue to grow at astonishing rates. Using questions contained in the USAID developed Household Food Insecurity Access Scale (HFIAS), questionnaires were administered to 300 randomly selected households in Soshanguve. Respondents were asked of their experiences of food insecurity (access) with a recall period of four weeks (30 days). Food secure households can utilise ICT tools in any manner to meet their food security needs. Our study finds that ICT access is Positively associated with household food security. Transactional purchases of items on credit using cellular or landline telephony are, in particular, important in enhancing food security. Otherwise, households could beg for or borrow food from neighbours. Only the educated in Soshanguve purchase food items online by using computer access. Younger, single, educated, employed individuals mostly use ICT to advance the course of their food security.","disorderly, disorganised, filthy,dirty,impoverished,marginalised, congested settlements,infrastructural scarcity",Negative,Yes,-,No,Diagnostic,Conceptualization of slums,"policy gaps, planning,public health","Improvement of life,livelihood improvement",-,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10708-021-10550-y

The proposed comparative tactic entails tracing the establishment of this connection in order to disassemble the constituent flows and localities merged within it. Subsequently, by posing questions to one another, a relational comparison of the trajectory of slum upgrading policy in each locality is composed, unearthing the political and institutional conditions that preceded the existence of the connection per se. In that sense, both eThekwini and SÃ£o Paulo are considered equivalent starting points from which local actors engaged in circulating ideas and mobilised slum upgrading policies. This paper not only brings a fresh approach to comparative methods â incorporating political contexts and their extensive overlapping networks of relations alongside a focus on particular policy trajectories â but also contributes to furthering global urban studies in two other ways. First, it provides insight into the processes by which policies are put on the move and localised (or not). Second, it demonstrates how repeated instances of urban practice may be unravelled by allowing each context of policy formation, with its distinctive trajectory of slum upgrading, to speak to one another. In this regard, the comparative analysis identified how, in both SÃ£o Paulo and eThekwini, the consolidation of democracy was followed by the development of more technocratic approaches to the detriment of earlier slum upgrading initiatives focussed on community empowerment.","disorderly, disorganised, filthy,dirty,impoverished,marginalised, congested settlements,infrastructural scarcity",Negative,Yes,-,No,Diagnostic,Conceptualization of slums,planning,"Improvement of life,livelihood improvement",-,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/00420980211059703

The focus of the review was on urban settings where growing needs and challenges have been registered over the past few years due to rapid increase in urban populations and urban slums. Methods: The review was conducted according to Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. Studies published in English between 2000 and 2019 were included. A narrative synthesis of both qualitative and quantitative data was undertaken. The record for registration in PROSPERO was CRD42019122066. Results: The review highlights a great variation in MNCH services utilization across urban sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). The main aspects of vulnerability to unequal and poor MNCH services utilization in urban settings of the region include poverty, low level of education, unemployment, lower socioeconomic status and poor livelihoods, younger maternal age, low social integration and social support, socio-cultural taboos, residing in slums, and being displaced, refugee, or migrant. At the health system level, persistent inequalities are associated with distance to health facility, availability of quality services and discriminating attitudes from health care personnel. Conclusion: Context-specific intervention programs that aim at resolving the identified barriers to access and use MNCH services, particularly for the most vulnerable segments of urban populations, are essential to improve the overall health of the region and universal health coverage (UHC) targets.","disorderly, disorganised, filthy,dirty,impoverished,marginalised, congested settlements,infrastructural scarcity",Negative,Yes,-,No,Diagnostic,Conceptualization of slums,planning,"slum upgrading, livelihood improvement",-,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10995-021-03250-z

In line with its developmental aspiration, the Ethiopian state engaged in large-scale inner-city slum redevelopment between 2009 and 2017 by displacing thousands of households to the periphery. Based on six months of qualitative research, this article interrogates the way the Ethiopia state framed the inner-city redevelopment using Bob Jessop's âStrategic-Relational Approach.â The article argues that the Ethiopian state framed slum redevelopment to project itself as a developmental and to enhance state control of the inner-city. At the same time, the state used inner-city redevelopment, to minimize the cost of the intervention through dispossessing inner-city residents and leasing the land at a higher premium. However, since 2012, there is a tendency to use the redevelopment for the accumulation of high-end developers by framing the redevelopment as a means to build the âDiplomatic Capital Africa.â Overall, the Ethiopian aspiring developmental state used slum redevelopment not only to facilitate accumulation but also to consolidate its tight grip on power.","disorderly, disorganised, filthy,dirty,impoverished,marginalised, congested settlements,infrastructural scarcity",Negative,Yes,-,No,Diagnostic,Conceptualization of slums,"planning, policy gaps, land tenure","Improvement of life,livelihood improvement",-,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cities.2020.102807

However, the cleanliness of shared latrines continues to be a problem in sub-Saharan Africa, including slums of Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. Investigating the barriers to cleaning of shared latrines may inform the future strengthening of comprehensive sanitation programs in slums of Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. Thus, a community-based unmatched caseâcontrol study was conducted among 100 case and 200 control households that were users of shared latrines from September to November 2017 in a slum district in Addis Ababa. Cases were those who had not cleaned their shared latrines and controls were those who had cleaned their shared latrines at least once during the week prior to data collection. Data were collected using a structured questionnaire and an on-the-spot-observational checklist and analyzed using bivariate (crude odds ratio [COD]) and multivariable (adjusted odds ratio [AOR]) unconditional logistic regression model. Variables having a p-value of less than 0.25 from the bivariate logistic regression analysis were retained into multivariable analysis. From the multivariable analysis, variables with p<0.05 were declared as factors significantly associated with barriers to cleaning of shared latrines. We found that about half 99 (49.5%) of shared latrines used by cases and almost one-third 32 (32.0%) of the shared latrines used by controls had visible cracks and spaces in the floor and slabs. The barriers to cleaning of shared latrines were found to be monthly household income of less than $55.60 USD (AOR = 1.80; 95%CI: 1.2â3.10), users feeling a lack of privacy during latrine use (AOR = 2.95; 95% CI: 1.60â5.43), no locking latch on the latrine door (AOR = 4.60; 95% CI: 2.43â8.79), inadequate ventilation of latrine (AOR: 4.88; 95% CI: 2.44â9.63), lack of regular monitoring of latrine by health extension workers (AOR = 2.86; 95%CI: 1.32â6.21) and a lack of enough water at home for cleaning the latrine (AOR = 4.91; 95% CI: 1.07â9.48). This study found several barriers to cleaning of shared latrines in slums of Addis Ababa. We recommend that stakeholders promote cleaning of shared latrines by designing programs to improve latrine privacy by adding or modifying the superstructure and including a door with locking latch, to make adjustments to the structure for better ventilation, to ensure regular monitoring of latrines by health extension workers and to make enough water consistently available for regular latrine cleaning.","disorderly, disorganised, filthy,dirty,impoverished,marginalised, congested settlements,infrastructural scarcity",Negative,Yes,-,No,Diagnostic,Conceptualization of slums,planning,-,-,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0263363

The assessment, conducted in August of 2022, engaged 15 women who participated in Uganda Youth Development Drop-in center activities. The objective was to assess mental health and the link between place and mental health. Facilitated group discussions and photograph review yielded the following results. In terms of understanding their views of mental health and wellbeing, participants clearly focused on feelings. However, they also assessed resilience, the environment and a personâs choice as relating to their mental health. Participants also found the physical spaces related to sports, education, worship, workplaces and green space to be linked to happiness. In terms of the attributes that were linked to sadness, participants listed the physical locations where drugs are sold, clubs for dancing and partying and also sanitation issues in the community. Participants frequently reported on the social environment and reflected on harassment, discrimination, alcohol use and criminal behavior that did not reflect a specific physical space, but rather the embedded social interactions they may face or observe by living in close proximity to hotspots for criminal activity. Given the dire shortages of mental health services and care that are available in this setting, a better understanding of young womenâs perceptions of place and mental health will be key for low-cost interventions and strategies to mitigate the contextual factors that may exacerbate mental illness.","disorderly, disorganised, filthy,dirty,impoverished,marginalised, congested settlements,infrastructural scarcity",Negative,Yes,-,No,Diagnostic,Conceptualization of slums,"planning, policy gaps, land tenure","inclusivity, slum upgrading",-,,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ijerph191912935

To promote health equity for slum dwellers, requires an understanding of how their lived realities shape inequities especially for young children 0-4 years old (ie, under-fives) who tend to have a higher mortality compared with non-slum children. In these proposed studies, we aim to examine how key Social Determinants of Health (SDoH) factors at child and household levels combine to affect under-five health conditions, who live in slums in Bangladesh and Kenya through an intersectionality lens. Methods and analysis The protocol describes how we will analyse data from the Nairobi Cross-sectional Slum Survey (NCSS 2012) for Kenya and the Urban Health Survey (UHS 2013) for Bangladesh to explore how SDoH influence under-five health outcomes in slums within an intersectionality framework. The NCSS 2012 and UHS 2013 samples will consist of 2199 and 3173 under-fives, respectively. We will apply Multilevel Analysis of Individual Heterogeneity and Discriminatory Accuracy approach. Some of SDoH characteristics to be considered will include those of children, head of household, mothers and social structure characteristics of household. The primary outcomes will be whether a child had diarrhoea, cough, fever and acute respiratory infection (ARI) 2 weeks preceding surveys. Ethics and dissemination The results will be disseminated in international peer-reviewed journals and presented in events organised by the Accountability and Responsiveness in Informal Settlements for Equity consortium and international conferences. Ethical approval was not required for these studies.

Whereas lockdowns contributed to the control of the pandemic, there were concerns about the unintended consequences of these measures especially in the most vulnerable populations. We assessed unintended socio-economic and health consequences due to the COVID-19 pandemic and the mitigation measures among slum dwellers in Kampala to inform the on-going and future pandemic response strategies. Methods: This was a mixed methods cross-sectional study conducted in Bwaise I and Bwaise III slums of Kawempe division, Kampala Uganda from October to December 2020. We used systematic sampling to randomly select 425 household heads for the face-to-face quantitative interviews. We also conducted six focus group discussions (FGDs) with slum dwellers and used photovoice among eight Community Health Workers (CHWs) to document unintended socio-economic and health consequences. Quantitative data were imported into STATA version 14.0 for analysis, while qualitative data were analysed thematically using NVivo version 12. Modified Poisson regression analysis was conducted to establish factors associated with impact on access to food. Results: Most respondents reported limited access to food (71.1%; 302/425); disruption in education (77.1%; 270/350); drop in daily income and wages (86.1%; 329/382) and loss of employment (63.1; 125/198). Twenty five percent of the respondents (25.4%; 86/338) reported domestic violence as one of the challenges. Seven themes emerged from the qualitative findings on the impact of COVID-19 including: limited access to food; negative impact on childrenâs rights (child labour and teenage pregnancies) and education; poor housing and lack of accommodation; negative social behaviours; negative impact on family and child care; reduced income and employment; and negative impact on health and access to health care services. Conclusion: The slum dwellers of Bwaise I and Bwaise III experienced several negative socio-economic and health consequences of COVID-19 and its prevention measures that severely affected their wellbeing. Children experienced severe consequences such as child labour and teenage pregnancies among the girls. Response activities should be contextualised to different settings and protocols to protect the vulnerable groups in the community such as children and women should be developed and mainstreamed in response activities.","disorderly, disorganised, filthy,dirty,impoverished,marginalised, congested settlements,infrastructural scarcity",Negative,Yes,-,No,Diagnostic,Conceptualization of slums,"policy gaps, planning,public health",-,-,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12889-021-12453-6

On the one hand, there is the risk of exploitation and dehumanization of slum dwellers; on the other hand, it can help fighting stereotypes and stigmatization. We explore the images of slum tourism shared online on a popular tourism website, TripAdvisor, and test their impact on stereotyping. Using a mixed-method approach, in Study 1 we analyze a large corpus of images of slumming experience to explore the social representations characterizing three typical destinations of slum tourism (Brazil, India, South Africa). In Study 2, we focus on India images of slum tourism, centered on contact with the local populations. Specifically, we test the impact of photo framing (as Tourism, TripAdvisor, Volunteerism, or no label) on three key stereotype dimensions (sociability, competence, morality). Results generally revealed detrimental effects on competence and morality by images framed as Tourism or TripAdvisor (but with also Positive effects on sociability), and Positive indirect effects (via more Positive photo category evaluation) of images framed as Volunteerism on the three stereotype dimensions.","disorderly, disorganised, filthy,dirty,impoverished,marginalised, congested settlements,infrastructural scarcity",Negative,Yes,-,No,Diagnostic,Conceptualization of slums,"policy gaps, planning,public health",slum upgrading,-,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijintrel.2022.08.002

We evaluated the impact of a livelihood intervention on the sexual and reproductive health and rights (SRHR) of young people in the slum areas of Kampala, Uganda. We carried out a repeated cross-sectional survey in 2014 and 2017 to examine the impact of community-based livelihood interventions on the SRHR of young people in the slum areas of Kampala, Uganda. Impacts were observed such as reduced sexual activity, reduction in aspects of gender-based violence attitudes and beliefs, increased access to and decision-making about contraceptive and family-planning services, increased availability and affordability of SRHR services, reduced need to seek further knowledge on SRHR, reduced barriers to HIV testing, and increased knowledge of health responsibilities. Unexpected results included: increased proportion of young people who had ever had sex, decreased mean age of sexual debut, unaffordability of contraceptives, and increased culturally shaped attitudes and social norms related to gender-based violence. We observed no impact on condom use, consensual sex and sexual assault, the number of sexual partners, knowledge about HIV/AIDS, stigma and discrimination against people living with HIV/AIDS, affordability of male and female condoms, and uptake of HIV testing services. Rights-based interventions are crucial to how we understand the SRHR of young people in complex sociocultural environments. While the livelihood interventions made significant impacts on the SRHR of young people, there are questions about how such interventions address deeply rooted sociocultural practices to maximise outcomes.","disorderly, disorganised, filthy,dirty,impoverished,marginalised, congested settlements,infrastructural scarcity",Negative,Yes,-,No,Diagnostic,Conceptualization of slums,"planning, policy gaps","livelihood improvement, slum upgrading",-,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11524-021-00596-1

While cities and towns (urban areas) are crucial to bolstering economic activities, they are equally perceived as the scene for social and economic problems. This in turn exacerbates urban human insecurity. The paper draws on qualitative research method in exploring the challenges and opportunities that undermine or facilitate achieving sustainable and inclusive cities in post-colonial Africa. Particularly, the role of the African Union through Agenda 2063 in materializing sustainable and efficient cities, against the backdrop of climate change, in post-colonial Africa. The study present statistics on urbanization and human security trends in the region such as the rate of urbanization, quality of life in informal settlements and slums, the share of urban population living in slums, and a correlation matrix on the quality of human development in slums. The study finds that while varied strides have been taken across the African continent on a national level, the problem of coordination, structural/systemic violence, prevalence of external vision for Africa's development, and gaps in policy implementation pose a threat to adequately addressing the perils of urbanization on human security in post-colonial Africa. Irrespective, Agenda 2063 offers the continent the opportunity to prioritize urban human insecurity issues as an emerging non-conventional security threat requiring securitization. Also, it offers an opportunity to re-center people at the heart of policy decisions while creating incentives for member states to meet the aspirations, goals, and targets set out in Agenda 2063, as it pertains to sustainable and inclusive cities in post-colonial Africa.","disorderly, disorganised, filthy,dirty,impoverished,marginalised, congested settlements,infrastructural scarcity",Negative,Yes,-,No,Diagnostic,Conceptualization of slums,"planning, policy gaps",-,-,,http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/frsc.2022.917764

However, in recent times, some scholars argue that informal urbanism has Positive implications for the attainment of the sustainable city development goals. Following this view, this study investigates the experimental projects (referred to as Experimental Informal Urbanism â EIU) developed by slum dwellers in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) in response to their deprivations and discusses their implications for the region's sustainable city development agenda. The study relied solely on secondary data (both scholarly and grey literature) that were extracted using search engines and data repositories such as Scopus, Web of Science, Google, Google Scholar, and the Mendeley Literature search function. The results indicate that slum residents in major cities in SSA have engineered innovative solutions to their deprivations. Some of the initiatives are: a) greenspace development on refuse dumpsites, b) solar-powered cars, c) productive reuse of plastic waste, organic waste, and electronic waste (e-waste), d) water sharing and e) plastic and sandbag housing. These innovative initiatives promote resilience and have Positive implications for the sustainable city development agenda of SSA cities. However, some of these initiatives could have adverse health and environmental consequences. We therefore call on states and city authorities to consciously take stock of innovative initiatives of slums and research ways to harness, replicate, and integrate them into their sustainable city development agenda.","disorderly, disorganised, filthy,dirty,impoverished,marginalised, congested settlements,infrastructural scarcity",Negative,Yes,-,No,Diagnostic,Conceptualization of slums,planning,"Slum upgrading,livelihood improvement",-,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scs.2022.103938

This commentary synthesizes commonalities in recent environmental health studies from urban cities in East and West Africa, presented during a symposium sponsored by the Africa Chapter of the International Society of Environmental Epidemiology (ISEE) in August 2020. A key takeaway from this symposium is the need for harmonization of epidemiologic and exposure data collection in three domains tailored to the SSA context: (1) improvements in socioeconomic status (SES) measurement through harmonization in the conceptualization and operationalization of SES indicators; (2) improvements in air pollution exposure assessment in resource-constrained contexts by better integration, validation, and harmonization of exposure data of air pollution and mitigating factors; and (3) harmonization in the assessment of health outcomes and biomonitoring of contaminants. Focusing on these three domains would galvanize environmental epidemiologists in SSA around shared data collection instruments and shared data platforms and facilitate the pooling of data across the continent. Fostering this collaborative research will enable researchers and decision-makers to glean new insights and develop robust environmental health interventions and policies for SSA urban slums and for improved population health.","disorderly, disorganised, filthy,dirty,impoverished,marginalised, congested settlements,infrastructural scarcity",Negative,Yes,-,No,Diagnostic,Conceptualization of slums,"policy gaps, planning,public health","Slum upgrading,livelihood improvement",-,,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ijerph191811273

We explore the patterns of healthcare utilization in these deprived neighborhoods by studying three such settlements in Nigeria. Methods The study was conducted in three slums in Southwestern Nigeria, categorized as migrant, indigenous or cosmopolitan, based on their characteristics. Using observational data of those who needed healthcare and used in-patient or out-patient services in the 12 months preceding the survey, frequencies, percentages and odds-ratios were used to show the study participantsâ environmental and population characteristics, relative to their patterns of healthcare use. Results A total of 1,634 residents from the three slums participated, distributed as 763 (migrant), 459 (indigenous) and 412 (cosmopolitan). Residents from the migrant (OR = 0.70, 95%CI: 0.51 to 0.97) and indigenous (OR = 0.65, 95%CI: 0.45 to 0.93) slums were less likely to have used formal healthcare facilities than those from the cosmopolitan slum. Slum residents were more likely to use formal healthcare facilities for maternal and perinatal conditions, and generalized pains, than for communicable (OR = 0.50, 95%CI: 0.34 to 0.72) and non-communicable diseases (OR = 0.61, 95%CI: 0.41 to 0.91). The unemployed had higher odds (OR = 1.45, 95%CI: 1.08 to 1.93) of using formal healthcare facilities than those currently employed. Conclusion The cosmopolitan slum, situated in a major financial center and national economic hub, had a higher proportion of formal healthcare facility usage than the migrant and indigenous slums where about half of families were classified as poor. The urban advantage premise and Anderson behavioral model remain a practical explanatory framework, although they may not explain healthcare use in all possible slum types in Africa. A context-within-context approach is important for addressing healthcare utilization challenges in slums in sub-Saharan Africa.","disorderly, disorganised, filthy,dirty,impoverished,marginalised, congested settlements,infrastructural scarcity",Negative,Yes,-,No,Diagnostic,Conceptualization of slums,planning,Slum upgrading,-,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0264725

The WHO states that about 35% of women in the world have had an experience once in a lifetime of either sexual and/or physical non-partner or intimate partner sexual violence (WHO, 2020). Gender-based violence is the most widespread, socially tolerated human rights violation in the world. It kills; disables and harms more people especially women. The violence can take many forms including physical, sexual, psychological, and economic violence (WHO, 2020). In Kenya, about 45% of women aged 15 - 49 years reported having experienced various forms of gender-based violence in their lifetime, and out of these, 29% women reported having had the experience in the previous year. Besides, 16% women had experienced sexual abuse in their lifetime, and 13% of the women had it in the previous year (KDHS, 2014). Kibera slums is one of the biggest informal settlements in Kenya and largest slum in Sub-Saharan Africa where various issues have been reported including insecurity, poor water, hygiene and sanitation, poor housing among others. Majority of its inhabitants are of very low socio-economic status. The purpose of this study was to explore the types of GBV prevalent in Kibera slums and the available interventions to address this problem. This study specific objectives were to identify the types of GBV reported by women of reproductive age in Kibera slums and to find out the types of GBV interventions offered to women of reproductive age in Kibera. The study adopted a cross-sectional study design. This used a mixed methods research where both qualitative and quantitative data were collected using a questionnaire and analyzed. The study respected the ethical considerations in research. The results showed that women of reproductive age in Kibera slums had experienced many forms of gender-based violence. Out the 390 respondents, 34 (8.7%) had experienced physical abuse, 95 (24.4%) had experienced verbal abuse and 60(15.4%) experienced sexual harassment while 91 (23.3%) of the respondents had not experienced any type of GBV. Most survivors 147 (49.1%) of GBV had never received any interventions. Only 39 (13.1%) of the survivors of GBV had received medical treatment, 44 (14.7%) had received guidance and counselling and incorporated to a support group, only 13 (4.3%) had taken legal measures against the perpetrators. In Kibera slums, all forms of gender-based violence are still prevalent and more interventions are needed to address this public health issue with a special focus on informal settlements.","violence, crime, dangerous,impoverished,marginalised,infrastructural scarcity",Negative,Yes,"sampling, interviewing",No,Diagnostic,Conceptualization of slums,planning,-,-,,http://dx.doi.org/10.37745/ijhpr.13/vol11n11521

According to WHO (2020), at least 1 in 3 women have experience physical or sexual violence. A study by NCRC (2020) showed cases of gender- based violence in Kenya reported between January and June, 2020 (that is 2,032) are way above the total numbers reported between January and December, 2019 (that is 1,057), representing 92.2% increase and confirming an escalation of incidents (NCRC, 2020). Kibera slum is not spared from GBV cases and other public health issues. A cross-section study was designed to determine the level of awareness of the available GBV interventions among women of reproductive age in Kibera slums and to determine the factors associated with awareness of available GBV interventions offered to women of reproductive age in Kibera slums, the second largest slums in Sub-Saharan Africa. The data was collected with a questionnaire from a sample of 390 interviewees. The findings showed that only 9 (2.3%) which is a small percentage had adequate awareness of the types of interventions that were available for GBV while 112 (28.7%) were not aware of any GBV interventions. The age, education level, occupation, affordability, accessibility, cultural factors, and acceptability of the services were the factors associated with the awareness of available GBV interventions. The study recommended the training of the public and private sectors on the importance of the GBV interventions so as to ensure that the survivors are attended to early enough to curb long- term consequences and that the perpetrators are punished for the vice and there is also a need to raise the women of Kibera slums from low socio-economic status which make them susceptible to and victims of GBV.","violence, crime, dangerous,impoverished,marginalised,infrastructural scarcity",Negative,Yes,-,No,Diagnostic,Conceptualization of slums,"policy gaps, planning,public health",-,-,,http://dx.doi.org/10.37745/ijhpr.13/vol11n12233

The increasing evasion of this discourse at the home front in sub-Saharan Africa is receiving greater academic and public health attention. In many Nigerian households, adolescents lack access to informative and undiluted communication with their parents, a situation that is worse for adolescents dwelling in slums. This study documented SRH issues and patterns of parent-adolescent communication in selected slums of Ibadan, Southwestern, Nigeria. A mixed sequential explanatory research was carried out in 10 selected slums in Ibadan, Oyo State, Nigeria. A structured questionnaire scripted on open data kits (ODK) and vignette for Focus Group Discussion (FGD) were used to obtain data from parents and adolescents. A sample of 796 parent-adolescent dyads was interviewed for the quantitative strand, and 8 FGDs were conducted for the qualitative component. Diagnostic techniques utilized for quantitative data included descriptive (frequency counts and percentages) and inferential (chi-square) statistics, while descriptive and interpretative analyses were adopted for qualitative data. Communication regarding SRH issues occurs in many households, but indirectly. A higher proportion of mothers discuss all SRH issues with their adolescents and better than fathers. While female adolescents engage their parents only on limited topics, the consequences of sexual behaviors are the least discussed. The chi-square values for each topic were not significant for parents and adolescents, however, only the discussion of preventive sexual practice was significant for parents (0.042) at a significant level of 0.05 and adolescents (0.000) at a significant level of 0.01. The findings of this study suggest that sexual education training intervention is germane to enhancing parent-adolescent communication on SRH issues for parents and adolescents.","disorderly, disorganised, filthy,dirty,impoverished,marginalised, congested settlements,infrastructural scarcity",Negative,Yes,-,No,Diagnostic,Conceptualization of slums,"planning, policy gaps",-,-,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/21582440231166607

In using the quantitative design, 20 variables were identified from a comprehensive literature review, and a quantitative survey was performed with 154 professionals with green cities development experience. Based on descriptive statistics and exploratory factor analysis, four major categories were developed namely, sustainable city planning, sustainable city management, integrative sustainable city design, and sustainable city and heritage preservation. This study provides insights into key green content for green cities development which will be useful to academia, industry practitioners, and policymakers. Although this study was limited in geographical scope to Ghana, the findings may apply to other cities in developing countries that share similar characteristics with Ghanaian cities.","disorderly, disorganised, filthy,dirty,impoverished,marginalised, congested settlements,infrastructural scarcity",Negative,Yes,-,No,Diagnostic,Conceptualization of slums,"planning, policy gaps, land tenure",-,-,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/15623599.2022.2068786
878,II,SIAMA PHILBERT,Journal,Sandbag housing construction in South Africa: life cycle assessment and operational energy modelling,"Saint R,Eltaweel A,Adetooto J,Pomponi F,Windapo A",Slums,2023,African,African,Abstract,"Purpose: Adequate and affordable housing is essential in tackling poverty and improving living and indoor health conditions for lower and medium-income families, in both developed and developing nations. However, there is a lack of affordable housing which directly causes homelessness and formation of slum-dwellings. Sub-Saharan Africa has the most urban slum dwellers with an estimated 53.6% of the urban population in sub-Saharan Africa dwelling in urban slums. Additionally, the housing deficit in South Africa currently stands at about 2.2 million units, with a projected housing demand of 500,000 housing units over 20 years. Given the climate crisis and need for affordable housing in South Africa, low-cost and low-carbon solutions are essential. Sandbag building technology (SBT) is one such promising solution, consuming less energy during construction and operation than conventional technologies as well as regulating the internal temperature of the building through thermal mass. However, there is still a need to assess how this simpler construction style and locally sourced building materials perform from a whole life cycle perspective. Thus, this paper presents a life cycle assessment (LCA) determining the holistic sustainability of a vernacular, sandbag house design in South Africa. Methods: The environmental LCA analysed the SBT under two scenarios: manual and automated, based on extraction of sand. The life cycle cost (LCC) analysis evaluated the SBT house from the different life cycle stages: design, production and operation, and disposal. The findings show that the carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e) emissions depend largely on the availability of locally sourced sand and whether the process is manual, automated, or both. Results: Upfront embodied CO2e emissions total 189 and 174 kgCO2e/m2 for the automated and manual scenarios, respectively. Assuming no decarbonisation, the operational emissions equal 7966 kgCO2e/m2, but could be as low as 1444 kgCO2e/m2 (achieving net zero by 2050). Whole life embodied CO2e impacts, i.e. stages A and C, total 262 and 247 kgCO2e/m2 for the automated and manual scenarios, respectively. The difference between the manual and automated scenarios can be significant at 15 kgCO2e/m2, equating to an additional 1125 kgCO2e for a 75m2 house. The estimated LCC for a 75 m2 building constructed with SBT is R 533,898.01 (US $31,167) or R 7118/m2. Conclusions: The sandbag method remains challenging for multi-storey construction due to the weight; however, it can contribute to low carbon, affordable housing in South Africa as a sandbag house does not need highly skilled labour or expensive materials.","disorderly, disorganised, filthy,dirty,impoverished,marginalised, congested settlements,infrastructural scarcity",Negative,Yes,-,No,Diagnostic,Conceptualization of slums,planning,-,-,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11367-023-02170-0

This study investigates the use of urban morphology to map slums in 95 cities across Nigeria, Kenya, Ghana, and Malawi. The approach employed an unsupervised classification and a tree-based clustering framework, integrating morphological and socio-economic indicators, as well as comprehensive sampling points for slums. Our findings indicate that morphological clusters with compact, small buildings are indicative of a high prevalence of slums, with an accuracy rate of 83.6%. Moreover, these morphological slum clusters exhibit significant correlations with socio-economic indicators, exhibiting lower GDP and wealth index compared to neighbouring clusters. Notably, larger and older slums demonstrate improved economic well-being and enhanced infrastructures services. Our findings underscore the potential of utilizing urban morphology to comprehend the diversity and dynamics of urban slums and socioeconomic development.

The focus is on post-apartheid Cape Town, where the city has increasingly adopted a ""fortress city"" model, similar to global cities like Los Angeles, Sao Paulo, and Rio de Janeiro. These cities exhibit a growing emphasis on privatized security systems in middle-class areas, including gated communities, shopping malls, and suburbs, characterized by measures like razor wire, electrified walls, security alarms, and surveillance. However, the paper highlights that across racial and class divides, urban ghettos experience poverty and violence, and socio-spatial inequalities persist despite desegregation efforts. The state, facing limited resources, outsources policing to private security firms in affluent areas, while working-class neighborhoods like Manenberg grapple with new spatial governance approaches, which are largely ineffective due to persistent social inequality, racial polarization, and economic shifts.

The article places the prison within a historical context, alongside other 'peculiar institutions' such as slavery, the Jim Crow regime, and the ghetto, all of which have been used to define and confine African Americans. The recent increase in black incarceration is attributed to the crisis of the ghetto as a means of social control and the need for an alternative system to contain lower-class African Americans. In the post-Civil Rights era, the prison and the ghetto have become intertwined, leading to a continuum of incarceration that disproportionately affects younger black men who are marginalized by the job market.

The focus is on how historical citizenship disparities in South Africa continue to be manifested in these longstanding informal settlements, influencing the repertoires of collective action. The research, based on archival materials and interviews in Atteridgeville, Gauteng, reveals that the ongoing struggle for equal citizenship draws on shared experiences of hardship and collective labor, creating social distance between local squatters and politically indifferent foreign newcomers. During protests, this division converges with practices of insurgent citizenship, providing a context for mobilization against foreigners.

905,II,CLINTON PATROBA,Book,From shacks to shanties: Working-class poverty and the 1913-1914 southern Colorado coalfield strike,"Chicone, Sarah J.",Other,2009,North American,North American,Abstract,"The Ludlow Massacre thrust the brutalities of labor conflict and the realities of working-class poverty into the American consciousness. The well-publicized reforms that followed the strike successfully focused national attention on ""improvements"" made to miners' lives and the new relationship forged between management and labor in the early twentieth century but did little to change the lived experience of southern Colorado coal miners. Framed as a measurable outcome and objectified as a generalized condition, poverty in the United States has relied on a consistent recycling of prejudices, characterized by shifting blame and ensuing responsibility. Whose fault is it, and who is responsible for correcting the problem? Blame oscillates between the poor themselves and the structures of the system; public policies routinely outline poverty as either a cultural (Lewis 1968) or an economic challenge and the poor as either deserving victims of the ""system"" or undeserving drains on society. These rotating dichotomies contribute to the ineffective and normalizing effects of public policies that systematically neglect the interests and conditions of America's working families. Contemporary Western definitions define poverty based on a measure of its materiality, whether absolute, as in the poverty line, or relative, rooted in comparative disadvantage (Iceland 2003:5). This falls short and objectifies the social relationships involved in poverty's production. As anthropologist Maia Green (2006:1124) has suggested, ""[T]he quantification of poverty permits [its] homogenization . . . across time and space."" Strict quantification limits the historicity of specific social relations, events, and circumstances that contribute to poverty's production. In short, these approaches characterize poverty as a discrete category; but as Maia Green (2006:1124) further contends, ""poverty is not a 'thing' to be attacked."" We need to move past current definitions and focus on the multiple social relations and ideological influences that create poverty as a project of difference. Poverty is a process. As such, it is a series of dialectically related influences, actions, and outcomes-defined in this case by the changing relationship between associated ideologies and materiality. Poverty is not limited to a theoretical project or defined by a specific materiality; instead, it is socially, economically, and historically contingent. Despite its connection and susceptibility to ideological influence, I do not mean to suggest that poverty is an exclusively conceptual paradigm; it is also grounded in materiality. Poverty results in real material consequences outside the social relations that use it to define the other. Reliance on solely materialist definitions, however, runs the risk of denying poverty's existence. If, for example, we recovered all this ""stuff "" and the dominant ideology holds that those designated as poor by social norms were not supposed to have had a lot of ""stuff,"" then archaeologists have traditionally had one of two conclusions. Either these folks were not as poor as we had first thought, or no wonder they were poor- They were spending money on all this stuff they did not need. Archaeology needs to move beyond a direct comparison of material culture against historically established ideologies (Karskens 2001; Mayne and Murray 2001; Yamin 1998, 2000, 2001) and beyond the demonstration of socioeconomic indicators based on a structural view of class (Beaudry et al. 1988; Bragdon 1988; Miller 1980, 1991; Potter 1992; Schmitt and Zeier 1993; Spencer-Wood 1987). Archaeological sources inform on material conditions. By its nature, archaeology looks at the materiality of the working poor, but beyond confirming its attributes-which is not a remarkable undertaking-it connects it to associated ideologies. Archaeological inquiry must make room for diverse interests without dehumanizing the working poor or denying their existence. Instead of comparing materiality against itself or against a dominant ideology of poverty, we should seek to account for the influence of materiality on ideology and of ideology on materiality. We need to allow for multiple negotiations by competing interest groups. Within the circumstances of the 1913-1914 southern Colorado Coalfield Strike, this explains how reconfigured relationships between labor and capital following the strike altered popular constructions of working-class poverty without effecting lasting change. The ways different interest groups frame, act upon, and exploit poverty are as essential to its production as is its associated materiality. This illuminates poverty's role as a constitutive project of social difference (Katz 1989) and its successful mobilization in projects of othering. In the case of the 1913-1914 southern Colorado Coalfield Strike these groups include, among others, the Colorado Fuel and Iron Company (CF&I), the United Mine Workers of America (UMWA), and striking miners and their families. As national and international rhetoric seeks to define and reduce poverty's consequences, anthropology has the potential to refocus attention on the social processes at work in poverty's production, to call into question its quantification and the homogenization of its effects and outcomes (Green 2006:1124). This chapter explores emergent historical narratives of working-class poverty and the role they play in shaping contemporary ideologies and public policy by focusing on the variety of housing accommodations before, during, and after the 1913-1914 southern Colorado Coalfield Strike. It examines both the materiality and ideology as they relate to stale and repetitive myths about the poor and their relative positions in the characteristically Western cycle of blame and responsibility. The analysis begins with this statement: striking coal miners were poor. This is a loaded assumption given what frames contemporary definitions and imaginings of ""real"" poverty. I will not quantify my position with absolute designations, nor do I feel it necessary to launch into an explanation of historically relative comparisons. Instead, taking a closer look at materiality and ideology, we can see how competing interest groups invested in the events of the 1913-1914 southern Colorado Coalfield Strike mobilized working-class poverty within the rhetoric of the conflict and used shelter in the process of social transformation. Both the UMWA and CF&I directly mobilized housing in the ideological battle waged during the dispute in mirrored attempts to frame the strikers as either deserving or undeserving poor. © 2009 by University Press of Colorado.

906,II,CLINTON PATROBA,Journal,"From slum to ghetto: Social deprivation in Kingston, Jamaica","Clarke, Colin",Other,2006,North American,North American,Abstract,"Massive population growth in the cities of the developing world since 1950 has given rise to high-density, inner-city slums and, since the 1960s, to the expansion of informal, usually squatted, settlements on the periphery of the original built-up area. The experience of Kingston, Jamaica, has been at odds with this generalisation, largely because of the absence of massive squatter developments, and the concentration of population in rental accommodation or in makeshift housing located on rented land near the city centre. As early as the late 1930s, the West India Royal Commission commented adversely on poor-quality housing and dense populations in Kingston, associated with multi-occupied tenements and rent yards. This paper traces the evolution of the rented, late colonial slum into the post-independence (1962) Kingston ghetto. The change in nomenclature is associated with the violence of the ghetto since political competition became endemic in the 1970s: in short, the slum (by analogy with the US urban ghettos) become a no-go area. Nevertheless, the ghetto can still be defined, using 1991 census materials, on the basis of essentially the same conditions as those revealed by the 1960 census. At both dates multiple deprivation was conditioned by low-class status, black race, and by high and persistent rates of rental and unemployment.

While Engsh is mainly spoken by upwardly mobile middle-class youth in Western Nairobi, Sheng is spoken by a much larger proportion of urban youth and has evolved from a stigmatized 'ghetto' code in eastern Nairobi into a prestigious code that symbolizes ideological affinity, in-group identity, coolness, generational rebellion, linguistic innovation, and rejection of tribal identities. Yet both languages have contributed to the expression of new forms of cultural meaning and to the construction of a linguistic third space between the global, represented by Western images and artefacts, and the local, represented by Kenyan /African symbols and languages. The growing importance of Sheng and Engsh in Kenyan literature and popular culture blurs established boundaries between Swahili and English, creates a space of hybridity in which multiple voices can be heard, and is likely to eventually expand the literary space in East Africa as a whole.",Ghetto,Negative,Yes,,No,Diagnostic,Nature of language in the informal settlements,,,,"Kaviti, L.

The Jewish ghetto of Renaissance Venice to which the term can be traced is the correct historical marker, serving as a model for all urban ghettos that have formed since, such as the many Jewish ghettos across Europe in the centuries that followed, the African-American ghetto created during the Fordist era of the United States (Chicago's South Side being a pure exemplar), the buraku of Japan, and the vast townships of apartheid South Africa. A ghetto is distinguished from other forms of urban marginality by, first, its roots in the discrimination toward and the complete and total spatial exclusion of one particular ethnoracial group, and second, a unique form of social organization resulting in a set of parallel institutions within the ghetto that replicate those of the society that created it.

Based upon her 2 decades of experience visiting Nairobi to conduct research the author reports how women living in the shacks of Mathare Valley are far more restricted than men in their choice of economic activity. During the early 1970s few local businesses were run by women and almost all women were involved in illegal beer brewing or prostitution. Women were at a disadvantage to men because they were less educated had fewer skills of commercial value and supported and cared for children. These handicaps though manifestly structural constraints are founded upon cultural norms. Norms are a combination of indigenous ideals and the Europeanviews imported during colonial domination. A contemporary consensus gives women the responsibility for child care and restricts the skills of most women to participation in the subsistence economy and domestic work. Over the span of 2 decades some Mathare residents have done very well but most residents were faced with increasingly fewer viable economic options.

I explore the different bases of exclusion of the informal-settlement population from the policy-making process, contrasting the barrier of class in Brazil with that of race in South Africa. I trace the early political tactics of patronage and clientelism in localized intervention efforts, alongside tactics of severe repression.

The social inequality found in the city's favelas affects this scenario. The sports mega-events Rio has recently hosted, such as the 2014 World Football Cup and the 2016 Olympic Games, brought new possibilities for tourism in the favelas. Tourists are attracted by the natural surroundings, with panoramic views and tracks into the urban forests. This work aims to explore some of these favelas and their natural surroundings. Communities such as Cantagalo-Pavão-Pavãozinho, Babilônia-Chapéu Mangueira and Vidigal have forest areas that were recovered and opened to the public as parks, and that have received the contribution of community-based organisations.

The article argues that the fruitful work of quantitative urban scholars on ethnic segregation in the UK has neglected Gypsy-Travellers. It suggests that the theoretical concept of the ghetto can elucidate the ways in which the spatial marginality of sites serves as a weapon of 'confinement and control' for the dominant, and an 'integrative and protective device' for the stigmatized Gypsy-Traveller population. Drawing on qualitative empirical data, key characteristics in Wacquant's definition of the ghetto are shown to hold true for Gypsy-Traveller sites; these include ethnic homogeneity, spatial confinement, shared cultural identity, mutual distancing and a retreat into the private sphere of the family. This comparison also reveals key differences in terms of economic function, parallel institutionalism and the relationship with the state. The article points to the potential offered by Wacquant's theory and suggests that the dismissal of the ghetto concept within the UK ignores its power as a tool of comparison. The article suggests that qualitative and theoretical approaches should seek to complement the work of quantitative social scientists through focusing on everyday social relations and encounters between ethnic minority groups and 'host' populations - both within and outwith residential boundaries.

My everyday observations of the all-Black neighbourhoods in Pretoria began from 2008 until 2020 where I was resident. Low income Black African migrants concentrate and socially interact within Black-majority neighbourhoods in Pretoria physically and socially segregated from other racial groups.

Many go so far as to speak of the large-scale ghettoization of Muslims, a trend commonly attributed to the states negligence towards this religious minority and prolonged histories of so-called communal violence between religious groups. Others emphasize long-standing pattern of residential clustering in enclaves and claim that these have always been voluntary. Both the ghetto and the enclave are usually considered highly segregated spaces, though. This paper complicates such views through an in-depth engagement with the seminal ethnographic volume Muslims in Indian Cities, edited by Laurent Gayer and Christophe Jaffrelot. Based on novel quantitative estimates of religious demography, I contrast and compare the same 11 cities studied in their book  Mumbai, Ahmedabad, Jaipur, Lucknow, Aligarh, Bhopal, Hyderabad, Delhi, Cuttack, Kozhikode and Bangalore  using statistical indices of segregation. This comparison with the ethnographic gold standard shows that the mere extent of segregation is an insufficient shortcut to the phenomenon of ghettoization: a ghetto actually need not be highly segregated and a mixed area can be surprisingly homogenous. Consequently, I argue that one should not only distinguish between voluntary and forced clustering but also consider the wider mental maps through which inhabitants experience, perceive and judge their city. Such mental maps specifically help to uncover historical trajectories, feelings of insecurity and the future expectations of people regarding their cities  irrespective of quantitative degrees of segregation.","Ghettoization, communal violence",Negative,Yes,,No,Diagnostic,Housing concerns,,,,"Susewind, R.

Often, the dwellings in such settlements are described as shacks, architecture of necessity, and architecture of everyday experience in the modern and the contemporary metropolis. This volume argues that the types of structures and settlements built by people who do not have access to architectural services in many cities in the developing parts of the world evolved simultaneously with the types of buildings that are celebrated in architecture textbooks as modernism.' It not only shows how architects can learn from traditional or vernacular dwellings in order to create habitations for the people of low-income groups in public housing scenarios, but also demonstrates how the architecture of the economically underprivileged classes goes beyond culturally-inspired tectonic interpretations of vernacular traditions by architects for high profile clients. Moreover, the essays explore how the resourceful dwellings of the underprivileged inhabitants of the great cities in developing parts of the world pioneered certain concepts of modernism and contemporary design practices such as sustainable and de-constructivist design. Using projects from Africa, Asia, South and Central America, as well as Austria and the USA, this volume interrogates and brings to the attention of academics, students, and practitioners of architecture, the deliberate disqualification of the modern architecture produced by the urban poor in different parts of the world.","Bidonville, Favela, ghetto, shanty town",Negative,Yes,,No,Diagnostic,Nature of the shacks in developing countries,,,,"Elleh, N.

Evidence from Settlement Leaders in India,Adam  Auerbach,Slums,2020,European,European,Abstract,"Slum settlements have received significant attention for their vulnerabilities to the spread of Covid-19. To mitigate risks of transmission, and alleviate economic distress associated with containment measures, public health experts and international agencies are calling for community-driven solutions that harness local participation. In slum settlements, such approaches will encounter the informal slum leaders present across cities of the Global South. How are slum leaders positioned to address the health and livelihood threats of the pandemic within their neighborhoods? What problem-solving activities, if any, have they performed for residents during the pandemic? What factors shape success in those efforts? To answer these questions, we conducted a phone survey of 321 slum leaders across 79 slum settlements in two north Indian cities. The survey was conducted in April and May 2020, at the height of India's stringent national lockdown in response to the virus. Our survey reveals striking continuities with pre-pandemic politics. First, slum leaders persist in their problem-solving roles, even as they shift their efforts towards requesting urgently needed government relief (particularly food rations). Second, slum leaders vary in their reported ability to gather information about relief schemes, make claims, and command government responsiveness. The factors that inform the effectiveness of slum leaders during 'normal times', notably their education and degree of embeddedness in party networks, continue to do so during the lockdown. Slum leader reliance on partisan networks raises concerns regarding the inclusiveness of their efforts. Finally, slums are not uniformly challenged in maintaining social distancing. Pre-pandemic disparities in infrastructural development fragment the degree to which residents must depart from social distancing guidelines to secure essential services.

These settlements are located mainly close to the city centre and have been allowed by the government for years. Unfortunately, they get little attention from the government and international agencies. The living conditions are poor and infrastructure virtually non-existent. These informal settlements became part of an informal economy when the demand for temporary housing (renting housing) grew fast. Young people look for a better life in the city and need a cheap place to stay. The owner pays little or no attention to the condition of these houses since the rent is very low and the effort too big. Small interventions of improvement by residents are made, but little is possible since this will lead to conflicts with the owners. Which interventions would benefit the residents and not only the owners? How could it be possible to improve housing conditions and by thus upgrade these informal settlements? On the basis of fieldwork and literature, an image of the situation is sketched as also a possible approach for this project.

 ABSTRACT
Understanding the proliferation of informal settlements in South Africa is significant becausethey have been a feature of our landscape for many years and will continue to be in the futurein spite of the attention given to the issue of housing by the government through varioushousing delivery interventions. Studies have indicated that informal settlements provideshelter for a large number of people who are the poor urban dwellers. There are gaps inliterature that demonstrate the distinction between informal settlements within the South African context, despite years of research conducted on informal settlements.The differentiation of informal settlements contests the homogeneity of informal settlementsthat fall into groupings and sub-categories that require targeted interventions specific to theircontexts. The Housing Development Agency (HDA, 2012
) is mandated to assist organs ofState with the upgrading of informal settlements
. One of its key activities is to profile informalsettlements, particularly in mining towns, in order to understand the data

They are often unplanned, illegal and organically developed places. In many cases, they do not comply with the citys development regulations. These settlements operate within significant deficiencies of formal supports, and people living in them suffer multiple forms of socio-economic marginalization. Increasing climate change induced hazards (i.e. water logging, drainage congestion, lack of drinkable water, salinity intrusion, annual cyclones) add additional vulnerability yet dwellers engage in diverse practices to adapt to these scarcities. This paper examines the relationships between the utilization of grassroots technology, the multi-purpose uses of tiny spaces by underprivileged people, and the ability of these people to cope with threats such as climate change. The study examines these relationships through a place attachment lens in which people, place and processes are the key components.

 One of the SDG (Sustainable Development Goals) programs being implemented by the Indonesia government is ""Sustainable Cities and Communities: Make cities andhuman settlements inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable"".

Slums are a drag on GDP, and lower life expectancy. By choosing to actsustainably we choose to build cities where all citizens live a decent quality of life, and

But not all settlements are always in a slum condition. In our findings, basicallythere are 3 kinds of transformation of the slum settlements, namely: (1) Zero to Hero:settlements that used to be slum and then transformed into good settlement, being toughand staying sustainable even becoming an

However, the focus of urban planning has not changed toaccommodate new urban trends. The current dominant practice of urban planning, still rootedin the global North realism, reflects an increasing discord between current approaches andgrowing problems of poverty, inequality, informality, rapid urbanisation and socio-spatialfragmentation. Traditional urban planning approaches and state-led direct settlementinterventions have arguably served to exclude the urban poor with a marked failure tosustainably address the problem of informal settlements. This research examines the case ofStellenbosch, Western Cape, and argues that the concept of coproduction is an alternativedynamic model that could be used to achieve inclusive and sustainable urban environments.Re-organising institutional relationships would arguably lead to a more successful service production approach and engagement between the state and the urban poor. I use the lens ofcoproduction to assess partnership-based in-situ community-driven informal settlementinterventions. The research uses the Langrug informal settlement upgrading programme as acase study to analyse the institutional arrangements and to examine power relations in acontext-specific coproduction process. The research uses semi-structured interviews, fieldobservations and secondary data to examine the nature of the partnership, institutionalrelations, scope and approach of the Langrug upgrade programme.The study concludes that the Langrug upgrade programme depicts a typical coproductionarrangement where many institutions are collaborating to improve the living conditions of theurban poor in Langrug.

The study recommends that the Slum Dwellers International (SDI) allianceneeds to build stronger grassroots structures in Stellenbosch to increase local capacity incommunity mobilisation and advocacy.

These assertions were repeated by Trevor Phillips, Director the Commission for Racial Equality, in an inflammatory speech claiming that Britain was sleepwalking into American-style segregation. The argument of this paper is that the index approach is indeed necessary, that ethnic segregation in Britain is decreasing, that the threshold criteria for the claim that British ghettos exist has manufactured ghettos rather than discovered them.

The paper argues that various strands of political thought, including liberalism, some Marxist perspectives, and nationalism, have struggled to acknowledge or have been reluctant to recognize the genuine political agency within shack settlements. It suggests that concepts like Partha Chatterjee's ""political society"" and Ananya Roy's ideas on subaltern urbanism can serve as valuable Diagnostic tools for better understanding and acknowledging political agency in these settlements.

One viewpoint argues that these settlements provide a means for households to escape rural poverty and access urban opportunities, potentially leading to improved prosperity. The contrasting perspective posits that the challenging conditions in these settlements trap residents in enduring hardship and insecurity. South Africa serves as a critical case study due to its significant social and spatial inequalities and the mixed policy stance toward shack settlements.

The refugees, living in small grass, bamboo, and mud shelters around the border town of Goma, are particularly vulnerable because many of their shelters lack plastic sheeting, which is essential for protection against the rain and wind. The rains exacerbate their living conditions by turning the camps into unsanitary swamps, leading to concerns about epidemics of dysentery, pneumonia, and malaria.

Despite successful implementation in rural areas, the introduction of female CHWs in urban slums for maternal health intervention has encountered high dropout rates. The main objective is to estimate the impact of CHW dropout from both BRAC and community perspectives, along with assessing the costs of potential dropout reduction strategies. Using the 'ingredient approach' for recruitment and training costs and the 'friction cost approach' for replacement costs, the study found that the average cost per regular CHW in 2009 was US$ 59.28. A one-month absence of a CHW resulted in significant forgone health services, including health education, antenatal visits, deliveries, referrals, and distribution of drugs.

Segregation initially took place in and along the urban periphery, reinforced during the late 1920s by Rios first urban plan. The 1930s and 1950s saw mass construction of cheap housing in the suburbs, away from the city and its infrastructure. From the 1950s onwards, the suburbs became so crowded that only swamps, mangrove areas, steep hills and riverbanks were left for occupation. Lack of affordable housing and of a suitable mass transportation system promotes the further spread of favelas all over Rio and the eastern parts, in particular.

There is intensive interaction between the FS and the IS, and, increasingly, they service each other's needs. This article will deal with the physical and social changes that have taken place over the last two decades in informal settlements, and in the informal provision of services and job opportunities. It will also deal with changes in the perceptions of government and other FS actors in the informal city drama, and how such changes relate to the Habitat Agenda.

The first, exemplified by Peru, involves the narrow legalization of tenure through titling. The second is Brazils broader approach to regularization that combines legal titling with the upgrading of public services, job creation, and community support structures. The author takes a sociolegal approach to this analysis. While local practices vary widely, most informal land developments in Latin America exhibit violations of the prevailing formal legal order governing land use, planning, registration, building, and taxation, and therefore have fundamental problems of illegality. Resolving these problems does not link directly to improvements in public services unless service upgrading is provided as part of a broader regularization program.","illegal,  substandard, insecure tenure",Positive,Yes,UN Habitat,Yes,Prescriptive,Land developments,,,,"Fernandes, E.

Squatter developments follow distinct patterns and develop unique characteristics which are affected by regional cultural variables. The paper presents a framework for investigating how different cultural practices effect the nature of squatter development. It first presents a brief overview of prevailing trends of thought regarding the formation of and response to informal housing development. Its principal argument then emerges from a cross-cultural comparison of cases of informal development in the Arab Middle East and Latin America. The comparison shows that there is no all encompassing model for processes of formation and maturation of squatter settlements.

India witnessed a rapid urban transition with its urban populations increasing from 27.81% in 2001 to 31.16% in 2011, while 52.8% of the world population lived in cities in 2010. On a significant note, among the South Asian cities, India has witnessed a rapid growth of slum population to the total urban population in the last few decades due to the rise of urbanisation in its cities. The slums in India are the manifestation of rapid urbanisation, urbanisation of poverty and exclusionary and unequal processes existing in the cities of India, proportionately involve rural migration to informal settlements in and around the cities.

The state could not provide housing for this enormous influx of people who had to settle in informal settlements known as katchi abadis where about 62 per cent of the citys population now resides. Since the city was small, the earlier informal settlements were close to work, entertainment, recreation, health and education facilities. Today, land for informal development is only available on the fringe of a huge conglomeration, far from all these facilities. Due to transport and time-related factors, it is cheaper to rent nearer the city than to own a house in an informal settlement on the periphery. In response, investors have informally converted old settlements into multi-storey apartments, increasing densities to the extent of severe overcrowding. Meanwhile, as a result of neo-liberal policies, developers today determine the form/shape of the city to the detriment of low income groups.

In fact, these settlements are unreasonable and disorganized agglomeration places for low income people who live indeprived areas of the cities. Given the importance of housing, especially in informal settlements, the current research intends tooutline the changes in housing indicators from margin to context and vice versa, especially in informal settlements of Tabrizmetropolis. A descriptive-evaluative methodology was used together with a field- documentary method applied for data collection.Here, in order to analyze the data and weighting of housing indicators (data layers), ANP model was used with Super Decisionsoftware. Also, GIS software was applied for generating maps. Additionally, the statistical community of the research includedinformal settlements of Tabriz metropolis. The findings together with consideration of changes in housing conditions for thestatistical blocks of the informal settlements indicated that , of 1318 blocks, 43/17% didn't change, 14/19% changed from deprivedcategory to wealthy, 7/36% changed from medium to wealthy level, 15/85% changed from deprived to medium level, 5/16% changedfrom wealthy to medium level, 7/21% changed from medium to deprived level, and 7/06% changed from wealthy to deprivedcategory.

INFORMAL SECTOR, NETWORKS AND INTRA-CITYVARIATIONS IN ACTIVITIES: FINDINGS FROM DELHI SLUMS
Arup Mitra

Institute of Economic Growth, Delhi, India
Based on a micro-survey of around 800 slum households in Delhi this paper highlightsthe role of networks in accessing jobs in the urban labor market. Primarily three types of networks have been identified, which operate through kinship bonds, caste and ethnicity bonds, and formal channels like NGOs and employment exchanges. The type of net-works used seems to vary across occupations. Based on a multinomial logit model the paper notes that given the differences in the nature of economic activities performed indifferent parts of the city, factors like networks and the urge to reside near the contact person and the work place make the urban labor market highly segmented. Hence, certain pockets within the city tend to get crowded by the growth of slums, and secondly inter-spatial variations in terms of activities/occupations make slum population in the city aheterogeneous set, and thus their problems and need vary substantially. Hence, any uni-form policy for clusters located in different zones may not be able to tackle effectivelythe problems of slum dwellers in the city.
1. Introduction
 Notwithstanding the difficulties involved in defining the urban informal sector, the termhas been used extensively, particularly in the empirical literature. Its relative size in India isquite large, and it is highly heterogeneous in nature, rendering it more difficult to suggest anyuniform policy for improving the living standards of the workers located in this sector (Mitra,1994). By and large the informal sector is seen to absorb residually in low productivity activi-ties the surplus labor relative to the demand in high productivity activities, and those who can-not afford to remain unemployed for long"

Incrementation and cumulation are methods introduced by the poor via informal mechanisms to sustain their existence in the city. Most of these informal settlements start the process bit by bit by putting up plastic sheets on bamboo poles. Over time, corrugated metal sheets and salvaged plywood panels replace the plastic sheets, which are later replaced by structures of bricks and mortar. Gradually, another floor is added and steel columns and beams take the load of the new vertical construction. Collective investments from the community or political interventions (primarily as slums are high-density vote banks) assist in obtaining amenities like water, electricity and drainage legally from the government or illegally from slum mafias. The vertical construction is razed down to build a strong concrete framed structure.","compact, dynamic, illegal",Positive,Yes,,No,Theoretical,the process of slum development is incremental and drivenby the poors efforts to create a habitable space in the city,,,,"Ambe, S.

ABSTRACT
 
Limited emphasis has been given towards understanding the different uses to which electricity isused for in slums in Kenya. Despite the enormous populations of many slums, the per-capitademand in informal settlement is quite small compared to that in regular settlements. Reachingslum residences requires a substantial investment in the expansion of the electricity distributionnetwork, but the potential payoff is small. This therefore means that electricity utility companiessuch as Kenya Power have little incentive to expand their distribution networks to slums. As suchthe energy needs and uses to which the urban poor employ energy for have greatly beenoverlooked and thus no clear understanding of the uses of electricity in urban slums. This studyhas investigated the influence of the Kenya Power Slum Electrification programmes has had onthe people of Munyaka informal settlement in Eldoret, Uasin Gishu County.","ilegal, inadequate services, expanding",Positive,Yes,,No,Theoretical,identifies a gap in understanding the uses of elecriticity  in urban slums in kenya and suggests that the limited per-capita demand has resulted in little incentive for electricity utility,,,,"Wainana, J.

The analysis shows thatsuccessful outcomes are intrinsically tied to the manner in which the upgrade process isimplemented.

A lot of literature on urban development in developingcountries has entirely focused on the nexus between rapidurbanization, Gross Geographic Product (GGP) and poverty growthwith little research that demonstrates what this impacts on urbansustainability especially with increasing slums in rapidly urbanizingAfrican countries. Available research has focused entirely onincreasing poverty level in urban Africa and its mitigation without aclear direction on what this means to slums improvement and urbansustainability. This papers aims to give a conceptual analysis thatwill help to understand the dynamics of urban sustainability andslums development. The historical perspectives and current realitiesof Kibera slums in Nairobi are reviewed.

Kenya is facing an increasing growth of informal settlements in her urban centers. As rapidurbanization takes its toll, so has the development and growth of slums. More than 34% ofKenyas total population lives in urban areas and of this, more than 71% is confined in informalsettlements (UN-Habitat, 2009).
